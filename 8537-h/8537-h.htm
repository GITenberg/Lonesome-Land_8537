    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. THE ARRIVAL OF VAL
    </h2>
    <p>
      In northern Montana there lies a great, lonely stretch of prairie land,
      gashed deep where flows the Missouri. Indeed, there are many such&mdash;big,
      impassive, impressive in their very loneliness, in summer given over to
      the winds and the meadow larks and to the shadows fleeing always over the
      hilltops. Wild range cattle feed there and grow sleek and fat for the fall
      shipping of beef. At night the coyotes yap quaveringly and prowl abroad
      after the long-eared jack rabbits, which bounce away at their
      hunger-driven approach. In winter it is not good to be there; even the
      beasts shrink then from the bleak, level reaches, and shun the still
      bleaker heights.
    </p>
    <p>
      But men will live anywhere if by so doing there is money to be gained, and
      so a town snuggled up against the northern rim of the bench land, where
      the bleakness was softened a bit by the sheltering hills, and a
      willow-fringed creek with wild rosebushes and chokecherries made a vivid
      green background for the meager huddle of little, unpainted buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the passengers on the through trains which watered at the red tank near
      the creek, the place looked crudely picturesque&mdash;interesting, so long
      as one was not compelled to live there and could retain a perfectly
      impersonal viewpoint. After five or ten minutes spent hi watching
      curiously the one little street, with the long hitching poles planted
      firmly and frequently down both sides&mdash;usually within a very few
      steps of a saloon door&mdash;and the horses nodding and stamping at the
      flies, and the loitering figures that appeared now and then in desultory
      fashion, many of them imagined that they understood the West and
      sympathized with it, and appreciated its bigness and its freedom from
      conventions.
    </p>
    <p>
      One slim young woman had just told the thin-faced school teacher on a
      vacation, with whom she had formed one of those evanescent traveling
      acquaintances, that she already knew the West, from instinct and from
      Manley's letters. She loved it, she said, because Manley loved it, and
      because it was to be her home, and because it was so big and so free. Out
      here one could think and grow and really live, she declared, with
      enthusiasm. Manley had lived here for three years, and his letters, she
      told the thin-faced teacher, were an education in themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The teacher had already learned that the slim young woman, with the
      yellow-brown hair and yellow-brown eyes to match, was going to marry
      Manley&mdash;she had forgotten his other name, though the young woman had
      mentioned it&mdash;and would live on a ranch, a cattle ranch. She smiled
      with somewhat wistful sympathy, and hoped the young woman would be happy;
      and the young woman waved her hand, with the glove only half pulled on,
      toward the shadow-dappled prairie and the willow-fringed creek, and the
      hills beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy!&rdquo; she echoed joyously. &ldquo;Could one be anything else, in such a
      country? And then&mdash;you don't know Manley, you see. It's horribly bad
      form, and undignified and all that, to prate of one's private affairs, but
      I just can't help bubbling over. I'm not looking for heaven, and I expect
      to have plenty of bumpy places in the trail&mdash;trail is anything that
      you travel over, out here; Manley has coached me faithfully&mdash;but I'm
      going to be happy. My mind is quite made up. Well, good-by&mdash;I'm so
      glad you happened to be on this train, and I wish I might meet you again.
      Isn't it a funny little depot? Oh, yes&mdash;thank you! I almost forgot
      that umbrella, and I might need it. Yes, I'll write to you&mdash;I should
      hate to drop out of your mind completely. Address me Mrs. Manley
      Fleetwood, Hope, Montana. Good-by&mdash;I wish&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She trailed off down the aisle with eyes shining, in the wake of the
      grinning porter. She hurried down the steps, glanced hastily along the
      platform, up at the car window where the faded little school teacher was
      smiling wearily down at her, waved her hand, threw a dainty little kiss,
      nodded a gay farewell, smiled vaguely at the conductor, who had been
      respectfully pleasant to her&mdash;and then she was looking at the rear
      platform of the receding train mechanically, not yet quite realizing why
      it was that her heart went heavy so suddenly. She turned then and looked
      about her in a surprised, inquiring fashion. Manley, it would seem, was
      not at hand to welcome her. She had expected his face to be the first she
      looked upon in that town, but she tried not to be greatly perturbed at his
      absence; so many things may detain one.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment a young fellow, whose clothes emphatically proclaimed him a
      cowboy, came diffidently up to her, tilted his hat backward an inch or so,
      and left it that way, thereby unconsciously giving himself an air of
      candor which should have been reassuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fleetwood was detained. You were expecting to&mdash;you're the lady he
      was expecting, aren't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had been looking questioningly at her violin box and two trunks
      standing on their ends farther down the platform, and she smiled vaguely
      without glancing at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I hope he isn't sick, or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take you over to the hotel, and go tell him you're here,&rdquo; he
      volunteered, somewhat curtly, and picked up her bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you.&rdquo; This time her eyes grazed his face inattentively. She
      followed him down the rough steps of planking and up an extremely dusty
      road&mdash;one could scarcely call it a street&mdash;to an uninviting
      building with crooked windows and a high, false front of unpainted boards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young fellow opened a sagging door, let her pass into a narrow
      hallway, and from there into a stuffy, hopelessly conventional fifth-rate
      parlor, handed her the bag, and departed with another tilt of the hat
      which placed it at a different angle. The sentence meant for farewell she
      did not catch, for she was staring at a wooden-faced portrait upon an
      easel, the portrait of a man with a drooping mustache, and porky cheeks,
      and dead-looking eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I expected bearskin rugs, and antlers on the walls, and big
      fireplaces!&rdquo; she remarked aloud, and sighed. Then she turned and pulled
      aside a coarse curtain of dusty, machine-made lace, and looked after her
      guide. He was just disappearing into a saloon across the street, and she
      dropped the curtain precipitately, as if she were ashamed of spying. &ldquo;Oh,
      well&mdash;I've heard all cowboys are more or less intemperate,&rdquo; she
      excused, again aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down upon an atrocious red plush chair, and wrinkled her nose
      spitefully at the porky-cheeked portrait. &ldquo;I suppose you're the
      proprietor,&rdquo; she accused, &ldquo;or else the proprietor's son. I wish you
      wouldn't squint like that. If I have to stop here longer than ten minutes,
      I shall certainly turn you face to the wall.&rdquo; Whereupon, with another
      grimace, she turned her back upon it and looked out of the window. Then
      she stood up impatiently, looked at her watch, and sat down again upon the
      red plush chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn't tell me whether Manley is sick,&rdquo; she said suddenly, with some
      resentment. &ldquo;He was awfully abrupt in his manner. Oh, you&mdash;&rdquo; She
      rose, picked up an old newspaper from the marble-topped table with
      uncertain legs, and spread it ungently over the portrait upon the easel.
      Then she went to the window and looked out again. &ldquo;I feel perfectly sure
      that cowboy went and got drunk immediately,&rdquo; she complained, drumming
      pettishly upon the glass. &ldquo;And I don't suppose he told Manley at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cowboy was innocent of the charge, however, and he was doing his
      energetic best to tell Manley. He had gone straight through the saloon and
      into the small room behind, where a man lay sprawled upon a bed in one
      corner. He was asleep, and his clothes were wrinkled as if he had lain
      there long. His head rested upon his folded arms, and he was snoring
      loudly. The young fellow went up and took him roughly by the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here! I thought I told you to straighten up,&rdquo; he cried disgustedly. &ldquo;Come
      alive! The train's come and gone, and your girl's waiting for you over to
      the hotel. D' you hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uh-huh!&rdquo; The man opened one eye, grunted, and closed it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other yanked him half off the bed, and swore. This brought both eyes
      open, glassy with whisky and sleep. He sat wobbling upon the edge of the
      bed, staring stupidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you get anything through you?&rdquo; his tormentor exclaimed. &ldquo;You want
      your girl to find out you're drunk? You got the license in your pocket.
      You're supposed to get spliced this evening&mdash;and look at you!&rdquo; He
      turned and went out to the bartender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you pour that coffee into him, like I told you?&rdquo; he demanded.
      &ldquo;We've got to get him steady on his pins <i>somehow!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bartender was sprawled half over the bar, apathetically reading the
      sporting news of a torn Sunday edition of an Eastern paper. He looked up
      from under his eyebrows and grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you going to pour coffee down a man that lays flat on his belly and
      won't open his mouth?&rdquo; he inquired, in an injured tone. &ldquo;Sleep's all he
      needs, anyway. He'll be all right by morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other snorted dissent. &ldquo;He'll be all right by dark&mdash;or he'll feel
      a whole lot worse,&rdquo; he promised grimly. &ldquo;Dig up some ice. And a good jolt
      of bromo, if you've got it&mdash;and a towel or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bartender wearily pushed the paper to one side, reached languidly
      under the bar, and laid hold of a round blue bottle. Yawning
      uninterestedly, he poured a double portion of the white crystals into a
      glass, half filled another under the faucet of the water cooler, and held
      them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dump that into him, then,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;It'll help some, if you get it
      down. What's the sweat to get him married off to-day? Won't the girl
      wait?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never asked her. You pound up some ice and bring it in, will you?&rdquo; The
      volunteer nurse kicked open the door into the little room and went in,
      hastily pouring the bromo seltzer from one glass to the other to keep it
      from foaming out of all bounds. His patient was still sitting upon the
      edge of the bed where he had left him, slumped forward with his head in
      his hands. He looked up stupidly, his eyes bloodshot and swollen of lid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'S the train come in yet?&rdquo; he asked thickly. &ldquo;'S you, is it, Kent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The train's come, and your girl is waiting for you at the hotel. Here,
      throw this into you&mdash;and for God's sake, brace up! You make me tired.
      Drink her down quick&mdash;the foam's good for you. Here, you take the
      stuff in the bottom, too. Got it? Take off your coat, so I can get at you.
      You don't look much like getting married, and that's no josh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fleetwood shook his head with drunken gravity, and groaned. &ldquo;I ought to be
      killed. Drunk to-day!&rdquo; He sagged forward again, and seemed disposed to
      shed tears. &ldquo;She'll never forgive me; she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent jerked him to his feet peremptorily. &ldquo;Aw, look here! I'm trying to
      sober you up. You've got to do your part&mdash;see? Here's some ice in a
      towel&mdash;you get it on your head. Open up your shirt, so I can bathe
      your chest. Don't do any good to blubber around about it. Your girl can't
      hear you, and Jim and I ain't sympathetic. Set down in this chair, where
      we can get at you.&rdquo; He enforced his command with some vigor, and Fleetwood
      groaned again. But he shed no more tears, and he grew momentarily more
      lucid, as the treatment took effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tears were being shed in the stuffy little hotel parlor. The young
      woman looked often at her watch, went into the hallway, and opened the
      outer door several times, meditating a search of the town, and drew back
      always with a timid fluttering of heart because it was all so crude and
      strange, and the saloons so numerous and terrifying in their very bald
      simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was worried about Manley, and she wished that cowboy would come out of
      the saloon and bring her lover to her. She had never dreamed of being
      treated in this way. No one came near her&mdash;and she had secretly
      expected to cause something of a flutter in this little town they called
      Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely, young girls from the East, come out to get married to their
      sweethearts, weren't so numerous that they should be ignored. If there
      were other people in the hotel, they did not manifest their presence, save
      by disquieting noises muffled by intervening partitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      She grew thirsty, but she hesitated to explore the depths of this dreary
      abode, in fear of worse horrors than the parlor furniture, and all the
      places of refreshment which she could see from the window or the door
      looked terribly masculine and unmoral, and as if they did not know there
      existed such things as ice cream, or soda, or sherbet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after an hour of this that the tears came, which is saying a good
      deal for her courage. It seemed to her then that Manley must be dead. What
      else could keep him so long away from her, after three years of
      impassioned longing written twice a week with punctilious regularity?
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that she was coming. She had telegraphed from St. Paul, and had
      received a joyful reply, lavishly expressed in seventeen words instead of
      the ten-word limit. And they were to have been married immediately upon
      her arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      That cowboy had known she was coming; he must also have known why Manley
      did not meet her, and she wished futilely that she had questioned him,
      instead of walking beside him without a word. He should have explained. He
      would have explained if he had not been so very anxious to get inside that
      saloon and get drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had always heard that cowboys were chivalrous, and brave, and
      fascinating in their picturesque dare-deviltry, but from the lone specimen
      which she had met she could not see that they possessed any of those
      qualities. If all cowboys were like that, she hoped that she would not be
      compelled to meet any of them. And <i>why</i> didn't Manley come?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that an inner door&mdash;a door which she had wanted to open,
      but had lacked courage&mdash;squeaked upon its hinges, and an ill-kept
      bundle of hair was thrust in, topping a weather-beaten face and a scrawny
      little body. Two faded, inquisitive eyes looked her over, and the woman
      sidled in, somewhat abashed, but too curious to remain outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; She seemed to be answering some inner question. &ldquo;I didn't know
      you was here.&rdquo; She went over and removed the newspaper from the portrait.
      &ldquo;That breed girl of mine ain't got the least idea of how to straighten up
      a room,&rdquo; she observed complainingly. &ldquo;I guess she thinks this picture was
      made to hang things on. I'll have to round her up again and tell her a few
      things. This is my first husband. He was in politics and got beat, and so
      he killed himself. He couldn't stand to have folks give him the laugh.&rdquo;
       She spoke with pride. &ldquo;He was a real handsome man, don't you think? You
      mighta took off the paper; it didn't belong there, and he does brighten up
      the room. A good picture is real company, seems to me. When my old man
      gets on the rampage till I can't stand it no longer, I come in here and
      set, and look at Walt. 'T ain't every man that's got nerve to kill himself&mdash;with
      a shotgun. It was turrible! He took and tied a string to the trigger&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The landlady stopped short and stared at her. &ldquo;What? Oh, I won't go into
      details&mdash;it was awful messy, and that's a fact. I didn't git over it
      for a couple of months. He coulda killed himself with a six-shooter; it's
      always been a mystery why he dug up that old shotgun, but he did. I always
      thought he wanted to show his nerve.&rdquo; She sighed, and drew her fingers
      across her eyes. &ldquo;I don't s'pose I ever will git over it,&rdquo; she added
      complacently. &ldquo;It was a turrible shock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; the girl began desperately, &ldquo;if Mr. Manley Fleetwood is in
      town? I expected him to meet me at the train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I kinda <i>thought</i> you was Man Fleetwood's girl. My name's
      Hawley. You going to be married to-night, ain't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I haven't seen Mr. Fleetwood yet,&rdquo; hesitated the girl, and her
      eyes filled again with tears. &ldquo;I'm afraid something may have happened to
      him. He&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hawley glimpsed the tears, and instantly became motherly in her
      manner. She even went up and patted the girl on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, now, don't you worry none. Man's all right; I seen him at dinner
      time. He was&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped short, looked keenly at the delicate
      face, and at the yellow-brown eyes which gazed back at her, innocent of
      evil, trusting, wistful. &ldquo;He spoke about your coming, and said he'd want
      the use of the parlor this evening, for the wedding. I had an idea you was
      coming on the six-twenty train. Maybe he thought so, too. I never heard
      you come in&mdash;I was busy frying doughnuts in the kitchen&mdash;and I
      just happened to come in here after something. You'd oughta rapped on that
      door. Then I'd 'a' known you was here. I'll go and have my old man hunt
      him up. He must be around town somewheres. Like as not he'll meet the
      six-twenty, expecting you to be on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled reassuringly as she turned to the inner door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take off your hat and jacket, and pretty soon I'll show you up to a
      room. I'll have to round up my old man first&mdash;and that's liable to
      take time.&rdquo; She turned her eyes quizzically to the porky-cheeked portrait.
      &ldquo;You jest let Walt keep you company till I get back. He was real good
      company when he was livin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled again and went out briskly, came back, and stood with her hand
      upon the cracked doorknob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I clean forgot your name,&rdquo; she hinted. &ldquo;Man told me, at dinner time, but
      I'm no good on earth at remembering names till after I've seen the person
      it belongs to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Valeria Peyson&mdash;Val, they call me usually, at home.&rdquo; The
      homesickness of the girl shone in her misty eyes, haunted her voice. Mrs.
      Hawley read it, and spoke more briskly than she would otherwise have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we're plumb strangers, but we ain't going to stay that way, because
      every time you come to town you'll have to stop here; there ain't any
      other place to stop. And I'm going to start right in calling you Val. We
      don't use no ceremony with folk's names, out here. Val's a real nice name,
      short and easy to say. Mine's Arline. You can call me by it if you want
      to. I don't let everybody&mdash;so many wants to cut it down to Leen, and
      I won't stand for that; I'm <i>lean</i> enough, without havin' it throwed
      up to me. We might jest as well start in the way we're likely to keep it
      up, and you won't feel so much like a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm awful glad you're going to settle here&mdash;there ain't so awful
      many women in the country; we have to rake and scrape to git enough for
      three sets when we have a dance&mdash;and more likely we can't make out
      more 'n two. D' you dance? Somebody said they seen a fiddle box down to
      the depot, with a couple of big trunks; d' you play the fiddle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little,&rdquo; Valeria smiled faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that'll come in awful handy at dances. We'd have 'em real often in
      the winter if it wasn't such a job to git music. Well, I got too much to
      do to be standin' here talkin'. I have to keep right after that breed girl
      all the time, or she won't do nothing. I'll git my old man after your
      fellow right away. Jest make yourself to home, and anything you want ask
      for it in the kitchen.&rdquo; She smiled in friendly fashion and closed the door
      with a little slam to make sure that it latched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valeria stood for a moment with her hands hanging straight at her sides,
      staring absently at the door. Then she glanced at Walt, staring
      wooden-faced from his gilt frame upon his gilt easel, and shivered. She
      pushed the red plush chair as far away from him as possible, sat down with
      her back to the picture, and immediately felt his dull, black eyes boring
      into her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fool I must be!&rdquo; she said aloud, glancing reluctantly over her
      shoulder at the portrait. She got up resolutely, placed the chair where it
      had stood before, and stared deliberately at Walt, as if she would prove
      how little she cared. But in a moment more she was crying dismally.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. WELL-MEANT ADVICE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Kent Burnett, bearing over his arm a coat newly pressed in the Delmonico
      restaurant, dodged in at the back door of the saloon, threw the coat down
      upon the tousled bed, and pushed back his hat with a gesture of relief at
      an onerous duty well performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had one hell of a time,&rdquo; he announced plaintively, &ldquo;and that Chink will
      likely try to poison me if I eat over there, after this&mdash;but I got
      her ironed, all right. Get into it, Man, and chase yourself over there to
      the hotel. Got a clean collar? That one's all-over coffee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fleetwood stifled a groan, reached into a trousers pocket, and brought up
      a dollar. &ldquo;Get me one at the store, will you, Kent? Fifteen and a half&mdash;and
      a tie, if they've got any that's decent. And hurry! Such a
      triple-three-star fool as I am ought to be taken out and shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went on cursing himself audibly and bitterly, even after Kent had
      hurried out. He was sober now&mdash;was Manley Fleetwood&mdash;sober and
      self-condemnatory and penitent. His head ached splittingly; his eyes were
      heavy-lidded and bloodshot, and his hands trembled so that he could
      scarcely button his coat. But he was sober. He did not even carry the odor
      of whisky upon his breath or his person; for Kent had been very thoughtful
      and very thorough. He had compelled his patient to crunch and swallow many
      nauseous tablets of &ldquo;whisky killer,&rdquo; and he had sprinkled his clothes
      liberally with Jockey Club; Fleetwood, therefore, while he emanated odors
      in plenty, carried about him none of the aroma properly belonging to
      intoxication.
    </p>
    <p>
      In ten minutes Kent was back, with a celluloid collar and two ties of
      questionable taste. Manley just glanced at them, waved them away with
      gloomy finality, and swore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're just about the limit, and that's no dream,&rdquo; sympathized Kent,
      &ldquo;but they're clean, and they don't look like they'd been slept in for a
      month. You've got to put 'em on&mdash;by George, I sized up the layout in
      both those imitation stores, and I drew the highest in the deck. And for
      the Lord's sake, get a move on. Here, I'll button it for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Behind Fleetwood's back, when collar and tie were in place, Kent grinned
      and lowered an eyelid at Jim, who put his head in from the saloon to see
      how far the sobering had progressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look fine!&rdquo; he encouraged heartily. &ldquo;That green-and-blue tie's just
      what you need to set you off. And the collar sure is shiny and nice&mdash;your
      girl will be plumb dazzled. She won't see anything wrong&mdash;believe <i>me</i>.
      Now, run along and get married. Here, you better sneak out the back way;
      if she happened to be looking out, she'd likely wonder what you were
      doing, coming out of a saloon. Duck out past the coal shed and cut into
      the street by Brinberg's. Tell her you're sick&mdash;got a sick headache.
      Your looks'll swear it's the truth. Hike!&rdquo; He opened the door and pushed
      Fleetwood out, watched him out of sight around the corner of Brinberg's
      store, and turned back into the close-smelling little room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he remarked to Jim, &ldquo;I never thought of it before, but I've
      been playing a low-down trick on that poor girl. I kinda wish now I'd put
      her next, and given her a chance to draw outa the game if she wanted to.
      It's stacking the deck on her, if you ask <i>me</i>!&rdquo; He pushed his hat
      back upon his head, gave his shoulders a twist of dissatisfaction, and
      told Jim to dig up some Eastern beer; drank it meditatively, and set down
      the glass with some force.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he said disgustedly, &ldquo;darn my fool soul, I stacked the deck on
      that girl&mdash;and she looked to be real nice. Kinda innocent and
      trusting, like she hasn't found out yet how rotten mean men critters can
      be.&rdquo; He took the bottle and poured himself another glass. &ldquo;She's sure due
      to wise up a lot,&rdquo; he added grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet your sweet life!&rdquo; Jim agreed, and then he reconsidered. &ldquo;Still, I
      dunno; Man ain't so worse. He ain't what you can call a real booze
      fighter. This here's what I'd call an accidental jag; got it in the
      exuberance of the joyful moment when he knew his girl was coming. He'll
      likely straighten up and be all right. He&mdash;&rdquo; Jim broke off there and
      looked to see who had opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Polly,&rdquo; he greeted carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man came forward, grinning skinnily. Polycarp Jenks was the outrageous
      name of him. He was under the average height, and he was lean to the point
      of emaciation. His mouth was absolutely curveless&mdash;a straight gash
      across his face; a gash which simply stopped short without any tapering or
      any turn at the corners, when it had reached as far as was decent. His
      nose was also straight and high, and owned no perceptible slope; indeed,
      it seemed merely a pendant attached to his forehead, and its upper
      termination was indefinite, except that somewhere between his eyebrows one
      felt impelled to consider it forehead rather than nose. His eyes also were
      rather long and narrow, like buttonholes cut to match the mouth. When he
      grinned his face appeared to break up into splinters.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was intensely proud of his name, and his pleasure was almost pathetic
      when one pronounced it without curtailment in his presence. His skinniness
      was also a matter of pride. And when you realize that he was an
      indefatigable gossip, and seemed always to be riding at large, gathering
      or imparting trivial news, you should know fairly well Polycarp Jenks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see Man Fleetwood's might' near sober enough to git married,&rdquo; Polycarp
      began, coming up to the two and leaning a sharp elbow upon the bar beside
      Kent. &ldquo;By granny, gitting married'd sober anybody! Dinner time he was so
      drunk he couldn't find his mouth. I met him up here a little ways just
      now, and he was so sober he remembered to pay me that ten I lent him t'
      other day&mdash;<i>he-he!</i> Open up a bottle of pop, James.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His girl's been might' near crying her eyes out, 'cause he didn't show
      up. Mis' Hawley says she looked like she was due at a funeral 'stid of a
      weddin'. 'Clined to be stuck up, accordin' to Mis' Hawley&mdash;shied at
      hearin' about Walt&mdash;<i>he-he!</i> I'll bet there ain't been a
      transient to that hotel in the last five year, man or woman, that ain't
      had to hear about Walt and the shotgun&mdash;Pop's all right on a hot day,
      you bet!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's got two trunks and a fiddle over to the depot&mdash;don't see how
      'n the world Man's going to git 'em out to the ranch; they're might' near
      as big as claim shacks, both of 'em. Time she gits 'em into Man's shack
      she'll have to go outside every time she wants to turn around&mdash;<i>he-he!</i>
      By granny&mdash;two trunks, to one woman! Have some pop, Kenneth, on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boys are talkin' about a shivaree t'-night. On the quiet, y' know.
      Some of 'em's workin' on a horse fiddle now, over in the lumber yard.
      Wanted me to play a coal-oil can, but I dunno. I'm gittin' a leetle old
      for sech doings. Keeps you up nights too much. Man had any sense, he'd
      marry and pull outa town. 'Bout fifteen or twenty in the bunch, and a
      string of cans and irons to reach clean across the street. By granny, I'm
      going to plug m' ears good with cotton when it comes off&mdash;<i>he-he!</i>
      'Nother bottle of pop, James.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's running the show, Polycarp?&rdquo; Kent asked, accepting the glass of
      soda because he disliked to offend. &ldquo;Funny I didn't hear about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Polycarp twisted his slit of a mouth knowingly, and closed one slit of an
      eye to assist the facial elucidation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't funny&mdash;not when I tell you Fred De Garmo's handing out the <i>in</i>vites,
      and he sure aims to have plenty of excitement&mdash;<i>he-he!</i> Betcher
      Manley won't be able to set on the wagon seat an' hold the lines t'-morrow&mdash;not
      if he comes out when he's called and does the thing proper&mdash;<i>he-he!</i>
      An' if he don't show up, they aim to jest about pull the old shebang down
      over his ears. Hope'll think it's the day of judgment, sure&mdash;<i>he-he!</i>
      Reckon I might's well git in on the fun&mdash;they won't be no sleepin'
      within ten mile of the place, nohow, and a feller always sees the joke
      better when he's lendin' a hand. Too bad you an' Fred's on the outs,
      Kenneth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't know&mdash;it suits me fine,&rdquo; Kent declared easily, setting
      down his glass with a sigh of relief; he hated &ldquo;pop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's it all about, anyway?&rdquo; quizzed Polycarp, hungering for the details
      which had thus far been denied him. &ldquo;De Garmo sees red whenever anybody
      mentions your name, Kenneth&mdash;but I never did hear no particulars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo; Kent was turning toward the door. &ldquo;Well, you see, Fred claims he can
      holler louder than I can, and I say he can't.&rdquo; He opened the door and
      calmly departed, leaving Polycarp looking exceedingly foolish and a bit
      angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Straight to the hotel, without any pretense at disguising his destination,
      marched Kent. He went into the office&mdash;which was really a saloon&mdash;invited
      Hawley to drink with him, and then wondered audibly if he could beg some
      pie from Mrs. Hawley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supper'll be ready in a few minutes,&rdquo; Hawley informed him, glancing up at
      the round, dust-covered clock screwed to the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want supper&mdash;I want pie,&rdquo; Kent retorted, and opened a door
      which led into the hallway. He went down the narrow passage to another
      door, opened it without ceremony, and was assailed by the odor of many
      things&mdash;the odor which spoke plainly of supper, or some other
      assortment of food. No one was in sight, so he entered the dining room
      boldly, stepped to another door, tapped very lightly upon it, and went in.
      By this somewhat roundabout method he invaded the parlor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manley Fleetwood was lying upon an extremely uncomfortable couch, of the
      kind which is called a sofa. He had a lace-edged handkerchief folded upon
      his brow, and upon his face was an expression of conscious unworthiness
      which struck Kent as being extremely humorous. He grinned understandingly
      and Manley flushed&mdash;also understandingly. Valeria hastily released
      Manley's hand and looked very prim and a bit haughty, as she regarded the
      intruder from the red plush chair, pulled close to the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fleetwood's head is very bad yet,&rdquo; she informed Kent coldly. &ldquo;I
      really do not think he ought to see&mdash;anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent tapped his hat gently against his leg and faced her unflinchingly,
      quite unconscious of the fact that she regarded him as a dissolute,
      drunken cowboy with whom Manley ought not to associate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's too bad.&rdquo; His eyes failed to drop guiltily before hers, but
      continued to regard her calmly. &ldquo;I'm only going to stay a minute. I came
      to tell you that there's a scheme to raise&mdash;to 'shivaree' you two,
      tonight. I thought you might want to pull out, along about dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manley looked up at him inquiringly with the eye which was not covered by
      the lace-edged handkerchief. Valeria seemed startled, just at first. Then
      she gave Kent a little shock of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have read about such things. A <i>charivari</i>, even out here in this
      uncivilized section of the country, can hardly be dangerous. I really do
      not think we care to run away, thank you.&rdquo; Her lip curled unmistakably.
      &ldquo;Mr. Fleetwood is suffering from a sick headache. He needs rest&mdash;not
      a cowardly night ride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Naturally Kent admired the spirit she showed, in spite of that eloquent
      lip, the scorn of which seemed aimed directly at him. But he still faced
      her steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure. But if I had a headache&mdash;like that&mdash;I'd certainly burn
      the earth getting outa town to-night. <i>Shivarees</i>&rdquo;&mdash;he stuck
      stubbornly to his own way of saying it&mdash;&ldquo;are bad for the head. They
      aren't what you could call silent&mdash;not out here in this uncivilized
      section of the country. They're plumb&mdash;&rdquo; He hesitated for just a
      fraction of a second, and his resentment of her tone melted into a twinkle
      of the eyes. &ldquo;They've got fifty coal-oil cans strung with irons on a rope,
      and there'll be about ninety-five six-shooters popping, and eight or ten
      horse-fiddles, and they'll all be yelling to beat four of a kind. They're
      going,&rdquo; he said quite gravely, &ldquo;to play the full orchestra. And I don't
      believe,&rdquo; he added ironically, &ldquo;it's going to help Mr. Fleetwood's head
      any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valeria looked at him doubtingly with steady, amber-colored eyes before
      she turned solicitously to readjust the lace-edged handkerchief. Kent
      seized the opportunity to stare fixedly at Fleetwood and jerk his head
      meaningly backward, but when, warned by Manley's changing expression, she
      glanced suspiciously over her shoulder, Kent was standing quietly by the
      door with his hat in his hand, gazing absently at Walt in his gilt-edged
      frame upon the gilt easel, and waiting, evidently, for their decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall tell them that Mr. Fleetwood is sick&mdash;that he has a horrible
      headache, and mustn't be disturbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent forgot himself so far as to cough slightly behind his hand. Valeria's
      eyes sparkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even out here,&rdquo; she went on cuttingly, &ldquo;there must be some men who are
      gentlemen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent refrained from looking at her, but the blood crept darkly into his
      tanned cheeks. Evidently she &ldquo;had it in for him,&rdquo; but he could not see
      why. He wondered swiftly if she blamed him for Manley's condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleetwood suddenly sat up, spilling the handkerchief to the floor. When
      Valeria essayed to push him back he put her hand gently away. He rose and
      came over to Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this straight goods?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Why don't you stop it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fred De Garmo's running this show. My influence wouldn't go as far&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fleetwood turned to the girl, and his manner was masterful. &ldquo;I'm going out
      with Kent&mdash;oh, Val, this is Mr. Burnett. Kent, Miss Peyson. I forgot
      you two aren't acquainted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From Valeria's manner, they were in no danger of becoming friends. Her
      acknowledgment was barely perceptible. Kent bowed stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to see about this, Val,&rdquo; continued Fleetwood. &ldquo;Oh, my head's
      better&mdash;a lot better, really. Maybe we'd better leave town&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your head is better, I don't see why we need run away from a lot of
      silly noise,&rdquo; Valeria interposed, with merciless logic. &ldquo;They'll think
      we're awful cowards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll try and find out&mdash;I won't be gone a minute, dear.&rdquo; After
      that word, spoken before another, he appeared to be in great haste, and
      pushed Kent rather unceremoniously through the door. In the dining room,
      Kent diplomatically included the landlady in the conference, by a gesture
      of much mystery bringing her in from the kitchen, where she had been
      curiously peeping out at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got to let her in,&rdquo; he whispered to Manley, &ldquo;to keep her face closed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They murmured together for five minutes. Kent seemed to meet with some
      opposition from Fleetwood&mdash;an aftermath of Valeria's objections to
      flight&mdash;and became brutally direct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead&mdash;do as you please,&rdquo; he said roughly. &ldquo;But you know that
      bunch. You'll have to show up, and you'll have to set 'em up, and&mdash;aw,
      thunder! By morning you'll be plumb laid out. You'll be headed into one of
      your four-day jags, and you know it. I was thinking of the girl&mdash;but
      if you don't care, I guess it's none of my funeral. Go to it&mdash;but
      darned if I'd want to start my honeymoon out like that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fleetwood weakened, but still he hesitated. &ldquo;If I didn't show up&mdash;&rdquo;
       he began hopefully. But Kent wittered him with a look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That bunch will be two-thirds full before they start out. If you don't
      show up, they'll go up and haul you outa bed&mdash;hell, Man! You'd likely
      start in to kill somebody off. Fred De Garmo don't love you much better
      than he loves me. You know what him and his friends would do then, I
      should think.&rdquo; He stopped, and seemed to consider briefly a plan, but
      shook his head over it. &ldquo;I could round up a bunch and stand 'em off, maybe&mdash;but
      we'd be shooting each other up, first rattle of the box. It's a whole lot
      easier for you to get outa town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell somebody you got the bridal chamber,&rdquo; hissed Arline, in a very
      loud whisper. &ldquo;That's number two, in front. I can keep a light going and
      pass back 'n' forth once in a while, to look like you're there. That'll
      fool 'em good. They'll wait till the light's been out quite a while before
      they start in. You go ahead and git married at seven, jest as you was
      going to&mdash;and if Kent'll have the team ready somewheres, I can easy
      sneak you out the back way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't get the team out of town without giving the whole deal away,&rdquo;
       Kent objected. &ldquo;You'll have to go horseback.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Val can't ride,&rdquo; Fleetwood stated, as if that settled the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn it, she's got to ride!&rdquo; snapped Kent, losing patience. &ldquo;Unless you
      want to stay and go on a toot that'll last a week, most likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Val belongs to the W.C.T.U.,&rdquo; shrugged Fleetwood. &ldquo;She'd never&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's that or have a fight on your hands you maybe can't handle. I
      don't see any sense in haggling about going, now you know what to expect.
      But, of course,&rdquo; he added, with some acrimony, &ldquo;it's your own business. I
      don't know what the dickens I'm getting all worked up over it for. Suit
      yourself.&rdquo; He turned toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She could ride my Mollie&mdash;and I got a sidesaddle hanging up in the
      coal shed. She could use that, or a stock saddle, either one,&rdquo; planned
      Mrs. Hawley anxiously. &ldquo;You better pull out, Man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, Kent! Don't rush off&mdash;we'll go,&rdquo; Fleetwood surrendered.
      &ldquo;Val won't like it, but I'll explain as well as I can, without&mdash;Say!
      you stay and see us married, won't you? It's at seven, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent's fingers curled around the doorknob. &ldquo;No, thanks. Weddings and
      funerals are two bunches of trouble I always ride 'way around. Time enough
      when you've got to be <i>it</i>. Along about nine o'clock you try and get
      out to the stockyards without letting the whole town see you go, and I'll
      have the horses there; just beyond the wings, by that pile of ties. You
      know the place. I'll wait there till ten, and not a minute longer. That'll
      give you an hour, and you won't need any more time than that if you get
      down to business. You find out from her what saddle she wants, and you can
      tell me while I'm eating supper, Mrs. Hawley. I'll 'tend to the rest.&rdquo; He
      did not wait to hear whether they agreed to the plan, but went moodily
      down the narrow passage, and entered frowningly the &ldquo;office.&rdquo; Several men
      were gathered there, waiting the supper summons. Hawley glanced up from
      wiping a glass, and grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, did you git the pie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naw. She said I'd got to wait for mealtime. She plumb chased me out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fred De Garmo, sprawled in an armchair and smoking a cigar, lazily fanned
      the smoke cloud from before his face and looked at Kent attentively.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. A LADY IN A TEMPER
    </h2>
    <p>
      To saddle two horses when the night has grown black and to lead them,
      unobserved, so short a distance as two hundred yards or so seems a simple
      thing; and for two healthy young people with full use of their wits and
      their legs to steal quietly away to where those horses are waiting would
      seem quite as simple. At the same time, to prevent the successful
      accomplishment of these things is not difficult, if one but fully
      understands the designs of the fugitives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawley Hotel did a flourishing business that night. The two long tables in
      the dining room, usually not more than half filled by those who hungered
      and were not over-nice concerning the food they ate, were twice filled to
      overflowing. Mrs. Hawley and the &ldquo;breed&rdquo; girl held hasty consultations in
      the kitchen over the supply, and never was there such a rattling of dishes
      hurriedly cleansed for the next comer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent managed to find a chair at the first table, and eyed the landlady
      unobtrusively. But Fred De Garmo sat down opposite, and his eyes were
      bright and watchful, so that there seemed no possible way of delivering a
      message undetected&mdash;until, indeed, Mrs. Hawley in desperation
      resorted to strategy, and urged Kent unnecessarily to take another slice
      of bacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have some more&mdash;it's <i>side</i>!&rdquo; she hissed in his ear, and
      watched anxiously his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Kent, and speared a slice with his fork, although his
      plate was already well supplied with bacon. Then, glancing up, he detected
      Fred in a thoughtful stare which seemed evenly divided between the
      landlady and himself. Kent was conscious of a passing, mental discomfort,
      which he put aside as foolish, because De Garmo could not possibly know
      what Mrs. Hawley meant. To ease his mind still further he glared
      insolently at Fred, and then at Polycarp Jenks <i>te-hee</i>ing a few
      chairs away. After that he finished as quickly as possible without
      exciting remark, and went his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not, however, been two minutes in the office before De Garmo
      entered. From that time on through the whole evening Fred was never far
      distant; wherever he went, Kent could not shake him off though De Garmo
      never seemed to pay any attention to him, and his presence was always
      apparently accidental.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I'll have to lick that son of a gun yet,&rdquo; sighed Kent, when a
      glance at the round clock in the hotel office told him that in just twenty
      minutes it would strike nine; and not a move made toward getting those
      horses saddled and out to the stockyards.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was much talk of the wedding, which had taken place quietly in the
      parlor at the appointed hour, but not a man mentioned a <i>charivari</i>.
      There were many who wished openly that Fleetwood would come out and be
      sociable about it, but not a hint that they intended to take measures to
      bring him among them. He had caused a box of cigars to be placed upon the
      bar of every saloon in town, where men might help themselves at his
      expense. Evidently he had considered that with the cigars his social
      obligations were canceled. They smoked the cigars, and, with the same
      breath, gossiped of him and his affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At just fourteen minutes to nine Kent went out, and, without any attempt
      at concealment, hurried to the Hawley stables. Half a minute behind him
      trailed De Garmo, also without subterfuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later the bridal couple stole away from the rear of the
      hotel, and, keeping to the shadows, went stumbling over the uneven ground
      to the stockyards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's the tie pile,&rdquo; Fleetwood announced, in an undertone, when they
      reached the place. &ldquo;You stay here, Val, and I'll look farther along the
      fence; maybe the horses are down there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valeria did not reply, but stood very straight and dignified in the shadow
      of the huge pile of rotting railroad ties. He was gone but a moment, and
      came anxiously back to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're not here,&rdquo; he said, in a low voice. &ldquo;Don't worry, dear. He'll
      come&mdash;I know Kent Burnett.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; queried Val sweetly. &ldquo;From what I have seen of the
      gentleman, your high estimate of him seems quite unauthorized. Aside from
      escorting me to the hotel, he has been anything but reliable. Instead of
      telling you that I was here, or telling me that you were sick, he went
      straight into a saloon and forgot all about us both. You know that. If he
      were your friend, why should he immediately begin carousing, instead of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn't,&rdquo; Fleetwood defended weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? Then perhaps you can explain his behavior. Why didn't he tell me you
      were sick? Why didn't he tell you I came on that train? Can you tell me
      that, Manley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manley, for a very good reason, could not; so he put his arms around her
      and tried to coax her into good humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweetheart, let's not quarrel so soon&mdash;why, we're only two hours
      married! I want you to be happy, and if you'll only be brave and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brave!&rdquo; Mrs. Fleetwood laughed rather contemptuously, for a bride.
      &ldquo;Please to understand, Manley, that I'm not frightened in the least. It's
      you and that horrid cowboy&mdash;<i>I</i> don't see why we need run away,
      like criminals. Those men don't intend to <i>murder</i> us, do they?&rdquo; Her
      mood softened a little, and she squeezed his arm between her hands. &ldquo;You
      dear old silly, I'm not blaming <i>you</i>. With your head in such a
      state, you can't think things out properly, and you let that cowboy
      influence you against your better judgment. You're afraid I might be
      annoyed&mdash;but, really, Manley, this silly idea of running away annoys
      me much more than all the noise those fellows could possibly make. Indeed,
      I don't think I would mind&mdash;it would give me a glimpse of the real
      West; and, perhaps, if they grew too boisterous, and I spoke to them and
      asked them not to be quite so rough&mdash;and, really, they only mean it
      as a sort of welcome, in their crude way. We could invite some of the
      nicest in to have cake and coffee&mdash;or maybe we might get some ice
      cream somewhere&mdash;and it might turn out a very pleasant little affair.
      I don't mind meeting them, Manley. The worst of them can't be as bad as
      that&mdash;but, of course, if he's your friend, I suppose I oughtn't to
      speak too freely my opinion of him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fleetwood held her closely, patted her cheek absently, and tried to think
      of some effective argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'll be drunk, sweetheart,&rdquo; he told her, after a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think so,&rdquo; she returned firmly. &ldquo;I have been watching the street
      all the evening. I saw any number of men passing back and forth, and I
      didn't see one who staggered. And they were all very quiet, considering
      their rough ways, which one must expect. Why, Manley, you always wrote
      about these Western men being such fine fellows, and so generous and
      big-hearted, under their rough exterior. Your letters were full of it&mdash;and
      how chivalrous they all are toward nice women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laid her head coaxingly against his shoulder. &ldquo;Let's go back, Manley.
      I&mdash;<i>want</i> to see a <i>charivari</i>, dear. It will be fun. I
      want to write all about it to the girls. They'll be perfectly wild with
      envy.&rdquo; She struggled with her conventional upbringing. &ldquo;And even if some
      of them are slightly under the influence&mdash;of liquor, we needn't <i>meet</i>
      them. You needn't introduce those at all, and I'm sure they will
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be silly, Val!&rdquo; Fleetwood did not mean to be rude, but a faint
      glimmer of her romantic viewpoint&mdash;a viewpoint gained chiefly from
      current fiction and the stage&mdash;came to him and contrasted rather
      brutally with the reality. He did not know how to make her understand,
      without incriminating himself. His letters had been rather idealistic, he
      admitted to himself. They had been written unthinkingly, because he wanted
      her to like this big land; naturally he had not been too baldly truthful
      in picturing the place and the people. He had passed lightly over their
      faults and thrown the limelight on their virtues; and so he had aided
      unwittingly the stage and the fiction she had read, in giving her a false
      impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Offended at his words and his tone, she drew away from him and glanced
      wistfully back toward the town, as if she meditated a haughty return to
      the hotel. She ended by seating herself upon a projecting tie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well, my lord,&rdquo; she retorted, &ldquo;I shall try and not be silly, but
      merely idiotic, as you would have me. You and your friend!&rdquo; She was very
      angry, but she was perfectly well-bred, she hoped. &ldquo;If I might venture a
      word,&rdquo; she began again ironically, &ldquo;it seems to me that your friend has
      been playing a practical joke upon you. He evidently has no intention of
      bringing any fleet steeds to us. No doubt he is at this moment laughing
      with his dissolute companions, because we are sitting out here in the dark
      like two silly chickens!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he's coming now,&rdquo; Manley said rather stiffly. &ldquo;Of course, I don't
      ask you to like him; but he's putting himself to a good deal of trouble
      for us, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasted effort, so far as I am concerned,&rdquo; Valeria put in, with a chirpy
      accent which was exasperating, even to a bridegroom very much in love with
      his bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness that muffled the land, save where the yellow flare of
      lamps in the little town made a misty brightness, came the click of shod
      hoofs. Another moment and a man, mounted upon a white horse, loomed
      indistinct before them, seeming to take substance from the night. Behind
      him trailed another horse, and for the first time in her life Valeria
      heard the soft, whispering creak of saddle leather, the faint clank of
      spur chains, and the whir of a horse mouthing the &ldquo;cricket&rdquo; in his bit.
      Even in her anger, she was conscious of an answering tingle of blood,
      because this was life in the raw&mdash;life such as she had dreamed of in
      the tight swaddlings of a smug civilization, and had longed for intensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent swung down close beside them, his form indistinct but purposeful.
      &ldquo;I'm late, I guess,&rdquo; he remarked, turning to Fleetwood. &ldquo;Fred got next,
      somehow, and&mdash;I was detained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; asked Manley, going up and laying a questioning hand upon
      the horse, by that means fully recognizing it as Kent's own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the oats box,&rdquo; said Kent laconically. He turned to the girl. &ldquo;I
      couldn't get the sidesaddle,&rdquo; he explained apologetically. &ldquo;I looked where
      Mrs. Hawley said it was, but I couldn't find it&mdash;and I didn't have
      much time. You'll have to ride a stock saddle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valeria drew back a step. &ldquo;You mean&mdash;a man's saddle?&rdquo; Her voice was
      carefully polite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes.&rdquo; And he added: &ldquo;The horse is dead gentle&mdash;and a
      sidesaddle's no good, anyhow. You'll like this better.&rdquo; He spoke, as was
      evident, purely from a man's viewpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      That viewpoint Mrs. Fleetwood refused to share. &ldquo;Oh, I couldn't ride a
      man's saddle,&rdquo; she protested, still politely, and one could imagine how
      her lips were pursed. &ldquo;Indeed, I'm not sure that I care to leave town at
      all.&rdquo; To her the declaration did not seem unreasonable or abrupt but she
      felt that Kent was very much shocked. She saw him turn his head and look
      back toward the town, as if he half expected a pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't reckon the oats box will hold Fred very long,&rdquo; he observed
      meditatively. He added reminiscently to Manley: &ldquo;I had a deuce of a time
      getting the cover down and fastened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm very sorry,&rdquo; said Valeria, with sweet dignity, &ldquo;that you gave
      yourself so much trouble&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm kinda sorry myself,&rdquo; Kent agreed mildly, and Valeria blushed hotly,
      and was glad he could not see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Val&mdash;you can ride this saddle, all right. All the girls out
      here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not come West to imitate all the girls. Indeed, I could never think
      of such a thing. I couldn't possibly&mdash;really, Manley! And, you know,
      it does seem so childish of us to run away&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent moved restlessly, and felt to see if the cinch was tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleetwood took her coaxingly by the arm. &ldquo;Come, sweetheart, don't be
      stubborn. You know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, really! If it's a question of obstinacy&mdash;You see, I look at
      the matter in this way: You believe that you are doing what is best for my
      sake; I don't agree with you&mdash;and it does seem as if I should be
      permitted to judge what I desire.&rdquo; Then her dignity and her sweet calm
      went down before a flash of real, unpolished temper. &ldquo;You two can take
      those nasty horses and ride clear to Dakota, if you want to. I'm going
      back to the hotel. And I'm going to tell somebody to let that poor fellow
      out of that box. I think you're acting perfectly horrid, both of you, when
      I don't want to go!&rdquo; She actually started back toward the scattered points
      of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not, however, get so faraway that she failed to hear Kent's &ldquo;Well,
      I'll be damned!&rdquo; uttered in a tone of intense disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care,&rdquo; she assured herself, because of the thrill of compunction
      caused by that one forcible sentence. She had never before in her life
      heard a man really swear. It affected her very much as would the
      accidental touch of an electric battery. She walked on slowly, stumbling a
      little and trying to hear what it was they were saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Kent passed her, loping back to the town, the led horse shaking his
      saddle so that it rattled the stirrups like castanets as he galloped. &ldquo;I
      don't care,&rdquo; she told herself again very emphatically, because she was
      quite sure that she did care&mdash;or that she would care if only she
      permitted herself to be so foolish. Manley overtook her then, and drew her
      hand under his arm to lead her. But he seemed quite sullen, and would not
      say a word all the way back.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. THE &ldquo;SHIVAREE&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      Kent jerked open the stable door, led in his horses, turned them into
      their stalls, and removed the saddles with quick, nervous movements which
      told plainly how angry he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll get myself all excited trying to do her a favor again&mdash;I don't
      think!&rdquo; he growled in the ear of Michael, his gray gelding. &ldquo;Think of me
      getting let down on my face like that! By a woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt along the wall in the intense darkness until his fingers touched a
      lantern, took it down from the nail where it hung, and lighted it. He
      carried it farther down the rude passage between the stalls, hung it high
      upon another nail, and turned to the great oats box, from within which
      came a vigorous thumping and the sound of muttered cursing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent was not in the mood to see the humor of anything in particular. Had
      he known anything about Pandora's box he might have drawn a comparison
      very neatly while he stood scowling down at the oats box, for certainly he
      was likely to release trouble in plenty when he unfastened that lid. He
      felt of the gun swinging at his hip, just to assure himself that it was
      there and ready for business in case Fred wanted to shoot, and rapped with
      his knuckles upon the box, producing instant silence within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't make so much noise in there,&rdquo; he advised grimly, &ldquo;not unless you
      want the whole town to know where you are, and have 'em give you the
      laugh. And, listen here: I ain't apologizing for what I done, but, all the
      same, I'm sorry I did it. It wasn't any use. I'd rather be shut up in an
      oats box all night than get let down like I was&mdash;and I'm telling you
      this so as to start us off even. If you want to fight about it when you
      come out, all right; you're the doctor. But I'm just as sorry as you are
      it happened. I lay down my hand right here. I hope you shivaree Man and
      his wife&mdash;and shivaree 'em good. I hope you bust the town wide open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why this sudden change of heart?&rdquo; came muffled from within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;that's my own business. Well, I don't like you a little bit, and
      you know it; but I'll tell you, just to give you a fair show. I wanted to
      keep Man sober, and I tried to get him and his wife out of town before
      that shivaree of yours was pulled off. But the lady wouldn't have it that
      way. I got let right down on my face, and I'm done. Now you know just
      where I stand. Maybe I'm a fool for telling you, but I seem to be in the
      business to-night. Come on out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He unfastened the big iron hasp, which was showing signs of the strain put
      upon it, and stepped back watchfully. The thick, oaken lid was pushed up,
      and Fred De Garmo, rather dusty and disheveled and purple from the close
      atmosphere of the box and from anger as well, came up like a
      jack-in-the-box and glared at Kent. When he had stepped out upon the
      stable floor, however, he smiled rather unpleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      {Illustration: He was jeered unmercifully by Fred De Garmo and his crowd}
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you've told the truth,&rdquo; he said maliciously, &ldquo;I guess the lady has
      pretty near evened things up. If you haven't&mdash;if I don't find them
      both at the hotel&mdash;well&mdash;Anyway,&rdquo; he added, with an ominous
      inflection, &ldquo;there'll be other days to settle this in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sure. Help yourself, Fred,&rdquo; Kent retorted cheerfully, and stood
      where he was until Fred had gone out. Then he turned and closed the box.
      &ldquo;Between that yellow-eyed dame and the chump that went and left this box
      wide open for me to tip Fred into,&rdquo; he soliloquized, while he took down
      the lantern, and so sent the shadows dancing weirdly about him, &ldquo;I've got
      a bunch of trouble mixed up, for fair. I wish the son of a gun would fight
      it out now, and be done with it; but no, that ain't Fred. He'd a heap
      rather wait and let it draw interest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Over in the hotel the &ldquo;yellow-eyed dame&rdquo; was doing her unsophisticated
      best to meet the situation gracefully, and to realize certain vague and
      rather romantic dreams of her life out West. She meant to be very
      gracious, for one thing, and to win the chivalrous friendship of every man
      who came to participate in the rude congratulations that had been planned.
      Just how she meant to do this she did not know&mdash;except that the
      graciousness would certainly prove a very important factor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to remain downstairs,&rdquo; she told Manley, when they reached the
      hotel. It was the first sentence she had spoken since he overtook her.
      &ldquo;I'm so glad, dear,&rdquo; she added diplomatically, &ldquo;that you decided to stay.
      I want to see that funny landlady now, please, and get her to serve coffee
      and cake to our guests in the parlor. I wish I might have had one of my
      trunks brought over here; I should like to wear a pretty gown.&rdquo; She
      glanced down at her tailored suit with true feminine dissatisfaction. &ldquo;But
      everything was so&mdash;so confused, with your being late, and sick&mdash;is
      your head better, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manley, in very few words, assured her that it was. Manley was struggling
      with his inner self, trying to answer one very important question, and to
      answer it truthfully: Could he meet &ldquo;the boys,&rdquo; do his part among them,
      and still remain sober? That seemed to be the only course open to him now,
      and he knew himself just well enough to doubt his own strength. But if
      Kent would help him&mdash;He felt an immediate necessity to find Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll find Mrs. Hawley somewhere around,&rdquo; he said hurriedly. &ldquo;I've got
      to see Kent&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Manley! Don't have anything to do with that horrid cowboy! He's not&mdash;nice.
      He&mdash;he swore, when he must have known I could hear him; and he was
      swearing about <i>me</i>, Manley. Didn't you hear him?&rdquo; She stood in the
      doorway and clung to his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; lied Manley. &ldquo;You must have been mistaken, sweetheart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I wasn't; I heard him quite plainly.&rdquo; She must have thought it a
      terrible thing, for she almost whispered the last words, and she released
      him with much reluctance. It seemed to her that Manley was in danger of
      falling among low associates, and that she must protect him in spite of
      himself. It failed to occur to her that Manley had been exposed to that
      danger for three years, without any protection whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was thankful, when he came to her later in the parlor, to learn from
      him that he had not held any speech with Kent. That was some comfort&mdash;and
      she felt that she needed a little comforting, just then. Her consultation
      with Arline had been rather unsatisfactory. Arline had told her bluntly
      that &ldquo;the bunch&rdquo; didn't want any coffee and cake. Whisky and cigars, said
      Arline, without so much as a blush, was what appealed to them fellows. If
      Manley handed it out liberal enough, they wouldn't bother his bride. Very
      likely, Arline had assured her, she wouldn't see one of them. That, on the
      whole, had been rather discouraging. How was she to show herself a
      gracious lady, forsooth, if no one came near her? But she kept these
      things jealously tucked away in the remotest corner of her own mind, and
      managed to look the relief she did not feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, after all, the <i>charivari</i>, as is apt to be the case when the
      plans are laid so carefully, proved a very tame affair. Valeria, sitting
      rather dismally in the parlor with Mrs. Hawley for company, at midnight
      heard a banging of tin cans somewhere outside, a fitful popping of
      six-shooters, and an abortive attempt at a procession coming up the
      street. But the lines seemed to waver and then break utterly at the first
      saloon, where drink was to be had for the asking and Manley Fleetwood was
      pledged to pay, and the rattle of cans was all but drowned in the shouts
      of laughter and talk which came from the &ldquo;office,&rdquo; across the hall. For
      where is the pleasure or the profit in <i>charivaring</i> a bridal couple
      which stays up and waits quite openly for the clamor?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it always so noisy here at night?&rdquo; asked Valeria faintly when Mrs.
      Hawley had insisted upon her lying down upon the uncomfortable sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no&mdash;unless a round-up pulls in, or there's a dance, or it's
      Christmas, or something. It's liable to keep up till two or three o'clock,
      so the sooner you git used to it, the better off you'll be. I'm going to
      leave you here, and go to bed&mdash;unless you want to go upstairs
      yourself. Only it'll be noisier than ever up in your room, for it's right
      over the office, and the way sound travels up is something fierce. Don't
      you be afraid&mdash;I'll lock this door, and if your husband wants to come
      in he can come through the dining room.&rdquo; She looked at Valeria and
      hesitated before she spoke the next sentence. &ldquo;And don't you worry a bit
      over him, neither. My old man was in the kitchen a minute ago, when I was
      out there, and he says Man ain't drinking a drop to-night. He's keeping as
      straight as&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valeria sat up suddenly, quite scandalized. &ldquo;Oh&mdash;why, of course
      Manley wouldn't drink with them! Why&mdash;who ever heard of such a thing?
      The idea!&rdquo; She stared reproachfully at her hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sure! I didn't say such a thing was liable to happen. I just thought
      you might be&mdash;worrying&mdash;they're making so much racket in there,&rdquo;
       stammered Arline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, no. I'm not at all worried, thank you. And please don't let me
      keep you up any longer, Mrs. Hawley. I am quite comfortable&mdash;mentally
      and physically, I assure you. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not even Mrs. Hawley could remain after that. She went out and closed the
      door carefully behind her, without even finding voice enough to return
      Valeria's sweetly modulated good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's got a whole lot to learn,&rdquo; she relieved her feelings somewhat by
      muttering as she mounted the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      What it cost Manley Fleetwood to abstain absolutely and without even the
      compromise of &ldquo;soft&rdquo; drinks that night, who can say? Three years of free
      living in Montana had lowered his standard of morality without giving him
      that rugged strength of mind which makes a man master of himself first of
      all. He had that day lain, drunken and sleeping, when he should have been
      at his mental and physical best to meet the girl who would marry him. It
      was that very defection, perhaps, which kept him sober in the midst of his
      taunting fellows. Now that Valeria was actually here, and was his wife, he
      was possessed by the desire to make some sacrifice by which he might prove
      his penitence. At any cost he would spare her pain and humiliation, he
      told himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did it, and he did it under difficulty. He was denied the moral support
      of Kent Burnett, for Kent was sulking over his slight, and would have
      nothing to say to him. He was jeered unmercifully by Fred De Garmo and his
      crowd. He was &ldquo;baptized&rdquo; by some drunken reveler, so that the stench of
      spilled whisky filled his nostrils and tortured him the night through. He
      was urged, he was bullied, he was ridiculed. His head throbbed, his
      eyeballs burned. But through it all he stayed among them because he feared
      that if he left them and went to Val, some drunken fool might follow him
      and shock her with his inebriety. He stayed, and he stayed sober. Val was
      his wife. She trusted him, and she was ignorant of his sins. If he went to
      her staggering and babbling incoherent foolishness, he knew it would break
      her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the sky was at last showing faint dawn tints and the clamor had worn
      itself out perforce&mdash;because even the leaders were, after all, but
      men, and there was a limit to their endurance&mdash;Manley entered the
      parlor, haggard enough, it is true, and bearing with him the stale odor of
      cigars long since smoked, and of the baptism of bad whisky, but also with
      the air of conscious rectitude which sits so comically upon a man unused
      to the feeling of virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      As is so often the case when one fights alone the good fight and manages
      to win, he was chagrined to find himself immediately put upon the
      defensive. Val, as she speedily demonstrated, declined to look upon him as
      a hero, or as being particularly virtuous. She considered herself rather
      neglected and abused. She believed that he had stayed away because he was
      angry with her on account of her refusal to leave town, and she thought
      that was rather brutal of him. Also, her head ached from tears and lack of
      sleep, and she hated the town, the hotel&mdash;almost she hated Manley
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manley felt the rebuff of her chilling silence when he came in, and when
      she twitched herself loose from his embrace he came near regretting his
      extreme virtue. He spent ten minutes trying to explain, without telling
      all of the truth, and he felt his good opinion of himself slipping from
      him before her inexorable disfavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't blame you for not liking the town, Val,&rdquo; he said at last,
      rather desperately. &ldquo;But you mustn't judge the whole country by it. You'll
      like the ranch, dear. You'll feel as if you were in another world&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; Val interrupted quellingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll drive out there just as soon as we have breakfast.&rdquo; He laid his
      hand diffidently upon her tumbled hair. &ldquo;I <i>had</i> to stay out there
      with those fellows. I didn't want to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want any breakfast,&rdquo; said Val, getting up and going over to the
      window&mdash;it would seem to avoid his caress. &ldquo;The odor of that dining
      room is enough to make one fast forever.&rdquo; She lifted the grimy lace
      curtain with her finger tips and looked disconsolately out upon the
      street. &ldquo;It's just a dirty, squalid little hamlet. I don't suppose the
      streets have been cleaned or the garbage removed from the back yards since
      the place was first&mdash;founded.&rdquo; She laughed shortly at the idea of
      &ldquo;founding&rdquo; a wretched village like that, but she had no other word at
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Arline</i>,&rdquo; she remarked, in a tone of drawling recklessness. &ldquo;Arline
      swears. Did you know it? I suppose, of course, you do. She said something
      that struck me as being shockingly true. She said I'm 'sure having a hell
      of a honeymoon.'&rdquo; Then she bit her lips hard, because her eyelids were
      stinging with the tears she refused to shed in his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Val!&rdquo; From the sofa Manley stared contritely at her back. She must
      feel terrible, he thought, to bring herself to repeat that sentence&mdash;Val,
      so icily pure in her thoughts and her speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val was blinking her tawny eyes&mdash;like the eyes of a lion in color&mdash;at
      the street. Not for the world would she let him see that she wanted to
      cry! A figure, blurred to indistinctness, appealed in a doorway nearly
      opposite, stood for a moment looking up at the reddened sky, and came
      across the street. As the tears were beaten back she saw and recognized
      him, with a curl of the lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here comes your cowboy friend&mdash;from a saloon, of course.&rdquo; Her voice
      was lazily contemptuous. &ldquo;Only his presence in the street was needed to
      complete the picture of desolation. He has been in a fight, judging from
      his face. It is all bruised and skinned, and one eye is swollen&mdash;ugh!
      My guide, my adviser&mdash;is it possible, Manley, that you couldn't find
      a <i>nice</i> man to meet me at the train?&rdquo; She turned from the
      disagreeable sight of Kent and faced her husband. &ldquo;Are all the men like
      that? And are all the women like&mdash;Arline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manley looked at her dumbly from the sofa. Would Val ever come to
      understand the place, and the people, he was wondering.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed suddenly. &ldquo;I'm beginning to feel very sorry for Walt,&rdquo; she
      said irrelevantly, pointing to the easel and the expressionless crayon
      portrait staring out from the gilt frame. &ldquo;He has to stay in this room
      always. And I believe another two hours would drive me hopelessly insane.&rdquo;
       The word caught her attention. &ldquo;Hope!&rdquo; she laughed ironically. &ldquo;What
      imbecile ever thought of hope in the same breath with this place? What
      they really ought to do is paint that 'Abandon-hope' admonition across the
      whole front of the depot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manley, because he had lifted his head too suddenly and so sent white-hot
      irons of pain clashing through his brain, turned sullen. &ldquo;If you hate it
      as bad as all that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why, there'll be a train for the East in
      about two hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val stiffened perceptibly, though the petulance in her face changed to
      something wistful. &ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;do you want me to go?&rdquo; she asked
      very calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manley pressed his fingers hard against his temples. &ldquo;You know I don't. I
      want you to stay and like the country, and be happy. But&mdash;the way you
      have been talking makes it seem&mdash;a-ah!&rdquo; He dropped his tortured head
      upon his hands and did not trouble to finish what he had intended to say.
      Nervous strain, lack of sleep, and a headache to begin with, were taking
      heavy toll of him. He could not argue with her; he could not do anything
      except wish he were dead, or that his head would stop aching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val took one of her unexpected changes of mood. She went up and laid her
      cold fingers lightly upon his temples, where she could see the blood
      beating savagely in the swollen veins. &ldquo;What a little beast I am!&rdquo; she
      murmured contritely. &ldquo;Shall I get you some coffee, dear? Or some headache
      tablets, or&mdash;You know a cold cloth helped you last evening. Lie down
      for a little while. There's no hurry about starting, is there? I&mdash;I
      don't hate the place so awfully, Manley. I'm just cross because I couldn't
      sleep for the noise. Here's a cushion, dear. I think it's stuffed with
      scrap iron, for there doesn't seem to be anything soft about it except the
      invitation to 'slumber sweetly,' in red and green silk; but anything is
      better than the head of that sofa in its natural state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She arranged the cushion to her own liking, if not to his, and when it was
      done she bent down impulsively and kissed him on the cheek, blushing
      vividly the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't be nasty and cross any more,&rdquo; she promised. &ldquo;Now, I'm going to
      interview Arline. I hear dishes rattling somewhere; perhaps I can get a
      cup of real coffee for you.&rdquo; At the door she shook her finger at him
      playfully. &ldquo;Don't you dare stir off that sofa while I'm gone,&rdquo; she
      admonished. &ldquo;And, remember, we're not going to leave town until your head
      stops aching&mdash;not if we stay here a week!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She insisted upon bringing him coffee and toast upon a tray&mdash;a
      battered old tray, purloined for that purpose from the saloon, if she had
      only known it&mdash;and she informed him, with a pretty, domestic pride,
      that she had made the toast herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arline was going to lay slices of bread on top of the stove,&rdquo; she
      explained. &ldquo;She said she always makes toast that way, and no one could
      tell the difference! I never heard of such a thing&mdash;did you, Manley?
      But I've been attending a cooking school ever since you left Fern Hill. I
      didn't tell you&mdash;I wanted it for a surprise. I could have done better
      with the toast before a wood fire&mdash;I think poor Arline was nearly
      distracted at the way I poked coals down from the grate; but she didn't
      say anything. Isn't it funny, to have cream in cans! I don't suppose it
      ever saw a cow&mdash;do you? The coffee's pretty bad, isn't it? But wait
      until we get home! I can make lovely coffee&mdash;if you'll get me a
      percolator. You will, won't you? And I learned now to make the most
      delicious fruit salad, just before I left. A cousin of Mrs. Forman's
      taught me how. Could you drink another cup, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manley could not, and she deplored the poor quality, although she
      generously absolved Arline from blame, because there seemed so much to do
      in that kitchen. She refused to take any breakfast herself, telling him
      gayly that the odor in the kitchen was both food and drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because he understood a little of her loathing for the place, Manley lied
      heroically about his headache, so that within an hour they were leaving
      town, with the two great trunks roped securely to the buckboard behind the
      seat, and with Val's suitcase placed flat in the front, where she could
      rest her feet upon it. Val was so happy at the prospect of getting away
      from the town that she actually threw a kiss in the direction of Arline,
      standing with her frowsy head, her dough-spotted apron, and her tired face
      in the parlor door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mood changed immediately, however, for she had no more than turned
      from waving her hand at Arline, when they met Kent, riding slowly up the
      street with his hat tilted over the eye most swollen. Without a doubt he
      had seen her waving and smiling, and so he must have observed the instant
      cooling of her manner. He nodded to Manley and lifted his hat while he
      looked at her full; and Val, in the arrogant pride of virtuous young
      womanhood, let her golden-brown eyes dwell impersonally upon his face; let
      her white, round chin dip half an inch downward, and then looked past him
      as if he were a post by the roadside. Afterwards she smiled maliciously
      when she saw, with a swift, sidelong glance, how he scowled and spurred
      unnecessarily his gray gelding.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. COLD SPRING RANCH
    </h2>
    <p>
      For almost three years the letters from Manley had been headed &ldquo;Cold
      Spring Ranch.&rdquo; For quite as long Val had possessed a mental picture of the
      place&mdash;a picture of a gurgly little brook with rocks and watercress
      and distracting little pools the size of a bathtub, and with a great,
      frowning boulder&mdash;a cliff, almost&mdash;at the head. The brook
      bubbled out and formed a basin in the shadow of the rock. Around it grew
      trees, unnamed in the picture, it is true, but trees, nevertheless. Below
      the spring stood a picturesque little cottage. A shack, Manley had
      written, was but a synonym for a small cottage, and Val had many small
      cottages in mind, from which she sketched one into her picture. The sun
      shone on it, and the western breezes flapped white curtains in the
      windows, and there was a porch where she would swing her hammock and gaze
      out over the great, beautiful country, fascinating in its very immensity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere beyond the cottage&mdash;&ldquo;shack,&rdquo; she usually corrected herself&mdash;were
      the corrals; they were as yet rather impressionistic; high, round,
      mysterious inclosures forming an effective, if somewhat hazy, background
      to the picture. She left them to work out their attractive details upon
      closer acquaintance, for at most they were merely the background. The
      front yard, however, she dwelt upon, and made aglow with sturdy,
      bright-hued flowers. Manley had that spring planted sweet peas, and
      poppies, and pansies, and other things, he wrote her, and they had come up
      very nicely. Afterward, in a postscript, he answered her oft-repeated
      questions about the flower garden:
    </p>
    <p>
      The flowers aren't doing as well as they might. They need your tender
      care. I don't have much time to pet them along. The onions are doing
      pretty well, but they need weeding badly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of that, the flowers bloomed luxuriantly in her mental picture,
      though she conscientiously remembered that they weren't doing as well as
      they might. They were weedy and unkempt, she supposed, but a little time
      and care would remedy that; and was she not coming to be the mistress of
      all this, and to make everything beautiful? Besides, the spring, and the
      brook which ran from it, and the trees which shaded it, were the chief
      attractions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps she betrayed a lack of domesticity because she had not been able
      to &ldquo;see&rdquo; the interior of the cottage&mdash;&ldquo;shack&rdquo;&mdash;very clearly.
      Sunny rooms, white curtains, bright cushions and books, pictures and rugs
      mingled together rather confusingly in her mind when she dwelt upon the
      inside of her future home. It would be bright, and cozy, and &ldquo;homy,&rdquo; she
      knew. She would love it because it would be hers and Manley's, and she
      could do with it what she would. She bothered about that no more than she
      did about the dresses she would be wearing next year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cold Spring Ranch! Think of the allurement of that name, just as it
      stands, without any disconcerting qualification whatever! Any girl with
      yellow-brown hair and yellow-brown eyes to match, and a dreamy temperament
      that beautifies everything her imagination touches, would be sure to build
      a veritable Eve's garden around those three small words.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that picture still before her mental vision, clear as if she had all
      her life been familiar with it in reality, she rode beside Manley for
      three weary hours, across a wide, wide prairie which looked perfectly
      level when you viewed it as a whole, but which proved all hills and
      hollows when you drove over it. During those three hours they passed not
      one human habitation after the first five miles were behind them. There
      had been a ranch, back there against a reddish-yellow bluff. Val had gazed
      upon it, and then turned her head away, distressed because human beings
      could consent to live in such unattractive surroundings. It was bad in its
      way as Hope, she thought, but did not say, because Manley was talking
      about his cattle, and she did not want to interrupt him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that there had been no houses of any sort. There was a barbed-wire
      fence stretching away and away until the posts were mere pencil lines
      against the blue, where the fence dipped over the last hill before the sky
      bent down and kissed the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The length of that fence was appalling in a vague, wordless way, Val
      unconsciously drew closer to her husband when she looked at it, and
      shivered in spite of the midsummer heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're getting tired.&rdquo; Manley put his arm around her and held her there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're over half-way now. A little longer and we'll be home.&rdquo; Then he
      bethought him that she might want some preparation for that home-coming.
      &ldquo;You mustn't expect much, little wife. It's a bachelor's house, so far.
      You'll have to do some fixing before it will suit you. You don't look
      forward to anything like Fern Hill, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val laughed, and bent solicitously over the suitcase, which her feet had
      marred. &ldquo;Of course I don't. Nothing out here is like Fern Hill. I know our
      ranch is different from anything I ever knew&mdash;but I know just how it
      will be, and how everything will look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Do you?&rdquo; Manley looked at her a bit anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For three years,&rdquo; Val reminded him, &ldquo;you have been describing things to
      me. You told me what it was like when you first took the place. You
      described everything, from Cold Spring Coulee to the house you built, and
      the spring under the rock wall, and even the meadow lark's nest you found
      in the weeds. Of <i>course</i> I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's going to seem pretty rough, at first,&rdquo; he observed rather
      apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but I shall not mind that. I want it to be rough. I'm tired to
      death of the smug smoothness of my life so far. Oh, if you only knew how I
      have hated Fern Hill, these last three years, especially since I
      graduated. Just the same petty little lives lived in the same petty little
      way, day in and day out. Every Sunday the class in Sunday school, and the
      bells ringing and the same little walk of four blocks there and back.
      Every Tuesday and Friday the club meeting&mdash;the Merry Maids, and the
      Mascot, both just alike, where you did the same things. And the same round
      of calls with mamma, on the same people, twice a month the year round. And
      the little social festivities&mdash;ah, Manley, if you only knew how I
      tong for something rough and real in my life!&rdquo; It was very nearly what she
      said to the tired-faced teacher on the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if that's what you want, you've come to the right place,&rdquo; he told
      her dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, when they drew close to a red coulee rim which he said was the far
      side of Cold Spring Coulee, she forgot how tired she was, and felt every
      nerve quiver with eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later still, when in the glare of a July sun they drove around a low
      knoll, dipped into a wide, parched coulee, and then came upon a barren
      little habitation inclosed in a meager fence of the barbed wire she
      thought so detestable, she shut her eyes mentally to something she could
      not quite bring herself to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted her out and tumbled the great trunks upon the ground before he
      drove on to the corrals. &ldquo;Here's the key,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you want to go in.
      I won't be more than a minute or two.&rdquo; He did not look into her face when
      he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val stood just inside the gate and tried to adjust all this to her mental
      picture. There was the front yard, for instance. A few straggling vines
      against the porch, and a sickly cluster or two of blossoms&mdash;those
      were the sweet peas, surely. The sun-baked bed of pale-green plants
      without so much as a bud of promise, she recognized, after a second
      glance, as the poppies. For the rest, there were weeds against the fence,
      sun-ripened grass trodden flat, yellow, gravelly patches where nothing
      grew&mdash;and a glaring, burning sun beating down upon it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cottage&mdash;never afterward did she think of it by that name, but
      always as a shack&mdash;was built of boards placed perpendicularly, with
      battens nailed over the cracks to keep out the wind and the snow. At one
      side was a &ldquo;lean-to&rdquo; kitchen, and on the other side was the porch that was
      just a narrow platform with a roof over it. It was not wide enough for a
      rocking-chair, to say nothing of swinging a hammock. In the first hasty
      inspection this seemed to be about all. She was still hesitating before
      the door when Manley came back from putting up the horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid your flowers are a lost cause,&rdquo; he remarked cheerfully. &ldquo;They
      were looking pretty good two or three weeks ago. This hot weather has
      dried them up. Next year we'll have water down here to the house. All
      these things take time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course they do.&rdquo; Val managed to smile into his eyes. &ldquo;Let's see
      how many dishes you left dirty; bachelors always leave their dishes
      unwashed on the table, don't they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes&mdash;but I generally wash mine.&rdquo; He led the way into the
      house, which smelled hot and close, with the odor of food long since
      cooked and eaten, before he threw all the windows open. The front room was
      clean&mdash;after a man's idea of cleanliness. The floor was covered with
      an exceedingly dusty carpet, and a rug or two. Her latest photograph was
      nailed to the wall; and when Val saw it she broke into hysterical
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've nailed your colors to the mast,&rdquo; she cried, and after that it was
      all a joke. The home-made couch, with the calico cushions and the cowhide
      spread, was a matter for mirth. She sat down upon it to try it, and was
      informed that chicken wire makes a fine spring. The rickety table, with
      tobacco, magazines, and books placed upon it in orderly piles, was
      something to smile over. The chairs, and especially the one cane rocker
      which went sidewise over the floor if you rocked in it long enough, were
      pronounced original.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the kitchen the same masculine idea of cleanliness and order obtained.
      The stove was quite red, but it had been swept clean. The table was pushed
      against the only window there, and the back part was filled with glass
      preserve jars, cans, and a loaf of bread wrapped carefully in paper; but
      the oilcloth cover was clean&mdash;did it not show quite plainly the marks
      of the last washing? Two frying pans were turned bottom up on an obscure
      table in an obscure corner of the room, and a zinc water pail stood beside
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were other details which impressed themselves upon her shrinking
      brain, and though she still insisted upon smiling at everything, she stood
      in the middle of the room holding up her skirts quite unconsciously, as if
      she were standing at a muddy street crossing, wondering how in the world
      she was ever going to reach the Other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it all&mdash;deliciously&mdash;primitive?&rdquo; she asked, in a weak
      little voice, when the smile would stay no longer. &ldquo;I&mdash;love it,
      dear.&rdquo; That was a lie; more, she was not in the habit of fibbing for the
      sake of politeness or anything else, so that the words stood for a good
      deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manley looked into the zinc water pail, took it up, and started for an
      outer door, rattling the tin dipper as he went. &ldquo;Want to go up to the
      spring?&rdquo; he queried, over his shoulder, &ldquo;Water's the first thing&mdash;I'm
      horribly thirsty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val turned to follow him. &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;the spring!&rdquo; She stopped,
      however, as soon as she had spoken. &ldquo;No, dear. There'll be plenty of other
      times. I'll stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave her a glance bright with love and blind happiness in her presence
      there, and went off whistling and rattling the pail at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val did not even watch him go. She stood still in the kitchen and looked
      at the table, and at the stove, and at the upturned frying pans. She
      watched two great horseflies buzzing against a window-pane, and when she
      could endure that no longer, she went into the front room and stared
      vacantly around at the bare walls. When she saw her picture again, nailed
      fast beside the kitchen door, her face lost a little of its frozen
      blankness&mdash;enough so that her lips quivered until she bit them into
      steadiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went then to the door and stood looking dully out into the parched
      yard, and at the wizened little pea vines clutching feebly at their
      white-twine trellis. Beyond stretched the bare hills with the wavering
      brown line running down the nearest one&mdash;the line that she knew was
      the trail from town. She was guilty of just one rebellious sentence before
      she struggled back to optimism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said I wanted it to be rough, but I didn't mean&mdash;why, this is just
      squalid!&rdquo; She looked down the coulee and glimpsed the river flowing calmly
      past the mouth of it, a majestic blue belt fringed sparsely with green. It
      must be a mile away, but it relieved wonderfully the monotony of brown
      hills, and the vivid coloring brightened her eyes. She heard Manley enter
      the kitchen, set down the pail of water, and come on to where she stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd forgotten you said we could see the river from here,&rdquo; she told him,
      smiling over her shoulder. &ldquo;It's beautiful, isn't it? I don't suppose,
      though, there's a boat within millions of miles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there's a boat down there. It leaks, though. I just use it for ducks,
      close to shore. Admiring our view? Great, don't you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val clasped her hands before her and let her gaze travel again over the
      sweep of rugged hills. &ldquo;It's&mdash;wonderful. I thought I knew, but I see
      I didn't. I feel very small, Manley; does one ever grow up to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed dimly to catch the note of utter desolation. &ldquo;You'll get used to
      all that,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;I thought I'd reached the jumping-off place,
      at first. But now&mdash;you couldn't dog me outa the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was slipping into the vernacular, and Val noticed it, and wondered
      dully if she would ever do likewise. She had not yet admitted to herself
      that Manley was different. She had told herself many times that it would
      take weeks to wipe out the strangeness born of three years' separation. He
      was the same, of course; everything else was new and&mdash;different. That
      was all. He seemed intensely practical, and he seemed to feel that his
      love-making had all been done by letter, and that nothing now remained
      save the business of living. So, when he told her to rest, and that he
      would get dinner and show her how a bachelor kept house, she let him go
      with no reply save that vague, impersonal smile which Kent had encountered
      at the depot.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he rattled things about in the kitchen, she stood still in the
      doorway with her fingers doubled into tight little fists, and stared out
      over the great, treeless, unpeopled land which had swallowed her alive.
      She tried to think&mdash;and then, in another moment, she was trying not
      to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glancing quickly over her shoulder, to make sure Manley was too busy to
      follow her, she went off the porch and stood uncertain in the parched
      inclosure which was the front yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may as well see it all, and be done,&rdquo; she whispered, and went
      stealthily around the corner of the house, holding up her skirts as she
      had done in the kitchen. There was a dim path beaten in the wiry grass&mdash;a
      path which started at the kitchen door and wound away up the coulee. She
      followed it. Undoubtedly it would lead her to the spring; beyond that she
      refused to let her thoughts travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      In five minutes&mdash;for she went slowly&mdash;she stopped beside a
      stock-trampled pool of water and yellow mud. A few steps farther on, a
      barrel had been sunk in the ground at the base of a huge gray rock; a
      barrel which filled slowly and spilled the overflow into the mud. There
      was also a trough, and there was a barrier made of poles and barbed wire
      to keep the cattle from the barrel. One crawled between two wires, it
      would seem, to dip up water for the house. There were no trees&mdash;not
      real trees. There were some chokecherry bushes higher than her head, and
      there were other bushes that did not look particularly enlivening.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a smile of bitter amusement, she tucked her skirts tightly around
      her, crept through the fence, and filled a chipped granite cup which stood
      upon a rock ledge, and drank slowly. Then she laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The water really <i>is</i> cold,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Anywhere else it would be
      delicious. And that's a spring, I suppose.&rdquo; Mercilessly she was stripping
      her mind of her illusions, and was clothing it in the harsher weave of
      reality. &ldquo;All these hills are Manley's&mdash;our ranch.&rdquo; She took another
      sip and set down the cup. &ldquo;And so Cold Spring Ranch means&mdash;all this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Down the coulee she heard Manley call. She stood still, pushing back a
      fallen lock of fine, yellow hair. She turned toward the sound, and the sun
      in her eyes turned them yellow as the hair above them. She was beautiful,
      in an odd, white-and-gold way. If her eyes had been blue, or gray&mdash;or
      even brown&mdash;she would have been merely pretty; but as they were, that
      amber tint where one looked for something else struck one unexpectedly and
      made her whole face unforgettably lovely. However, the color of her eyes
      and her hair did not interest her then, or make life any easier. She was
      quite ordinarily miserable and homesick, as she went reluctantly back
      along the grassy trails The odor of fried bacon came up to her, and she
      hated bacon. She hated everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been to the spring,&rdquo; she called out, resolutely cheerful, as soon as
      she came in sight of Manley, waiting in the kitchen door; she ran toward
      him lightly. &ldquo;However does the water keep so deliciously cool through this
      hot weather? I don't wonder you call this Cold Spring Ranch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manley straightened proudly. &ldquo;I'm glad you like it; I was afraid you might
      not, just at first. But you're the right stuff&mdash;I might have known
      it. Not every woman could come out here and appreciate this country right
      at the start.&rdquo;

    <p>
      Val stopped at the steps, panting a little from her run, and smiled
      unflinchingly up into his face.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. MANLEY'S FIRE GUARD
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hot sunlight, winds as hot, a shimmering heat which distorted objects at a
      distance and made the sky line a dazzling, wavering ribbon of faded blue;
      and then the dull haze of smoke which hung over the land, and, without
      tempering the heat, turned the sun into a huge coppery balloon, which
      drifted imperceptibly from the east to the west, and at evening time
      settled softly down upon a parched hilltop and disappeared, leaving behind
      it an ominous red glow as of hidden fires.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the wind blew, the touch of it seared the face, as the smoke tang
      assailed the nostrils. All the world was a weird, unnatural tint, hard to
      name, never to be forgotten. The far horizons drew steadily closer as the
      days passed slowly and thickened the veil of smoke. The distant mountains
      drew daily back into dimmer distance; became an obscure, formless blot
      against the sky, and vanished completely. The horizon crouched then upon
      the bluffs across the river, moved up to the line of trees along its
      banks, blotted them out one day, and impudently established itself
      half-way up the coulee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time ceased to be measured accurately; events moved slowly in an unreal
      world of sultry heat and smoke and a red sun wading heavily through the
      copper-brown sky from the east to the west, and a moon as red which
      followed meekly after.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men rode uneasily here and there, and when they met they talked of prairie
      fires and of fire guards and the direction of the wind, and of the faint
      prospect of rain. Cattle, driven from their accustomed feeding grounds,
      wandered aimlessly over the still-unburned range, and lowed often in the
      night as they drifted before the flame-heated wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifteen miles to the east of Cold Spring Coulee, the Wishbone outfit
      watched uneasily the deepening haze. Kent and Bob Royden were put to
      riding the range from the river north and west, and Polycarp Jenks, who
      had taken a claim where were good water and some shelter, and who never
      seemed to be there for more than a few hours at a time, because of his
      boundless curiosity, wandered about on his great, raw-boned sorrel with
      the white legs, and seemed always to have the latest fire news on the tip
      of his tongue, and always eager to impart it to somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the northwest there was the Double Diamond, also sleeping with both
      eyes open, so to speak. They also had two men out watching the range,
      though the fires were said to be all across the river. But there was the
      railroad seaming the country straight through the grassland, and though
      the company was prompt at plowing fire guards, contract work would always
      bear watching, said the stockmen, and with the high winds that prevailed
      there was no telling what might happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Fred De Garmo and Bill Madison patrolled the country in rather
      desultory fashion, if the truth be known. They liked best to ride to the
      north and east&mdash;which, while following faithfully the railroad and
      the danger line, would bring them eventually to Hope, where they never
      failed to stop as long as they dared. For, although they never analyzed
      their feelings, they knew that as long as they kept their jobs and their
      pay was forthcoming, a few miles of blackened range concerned them
      personally not at all. Still, barring a fondness for the trail which led
      to town, they were not unfaithful to their trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Kent and Polycarp met on the brink of a deep coulee, and, as is
      the way of men who ride the dim trails, they stopped to talk a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polycarp, cracking his face across the middle with his habitual grin,
      straightened his right leg to its full length, slid his hand with
      difficulty into his pocket, brought up a dirty fragment of &ldquo;plug&rdquo; tobacco,
      looked it over inquiringly, and pried off the corner with his teeth. When
      he had rolled it comfortably into his cheek and had straightened his leg
      and replaced the tobacco in his pocket, he was &ldquo;all set&rdquo; and ready for
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent had taken the opportunity to roll a cigarette, though smoking on the
      range was a weakness to be indulged in with much care. He pinched out the
      blaze of his match, as usual, and then spat upon it for added safety
      before throwing it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this heat doesn't let up,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;the grass is going to blaze
      up from sunburn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won't need to, if you ask me. I wouldn't be su'prised to see this hull
      range afire any time. Between you an' me, Kenneth, them Double Diamond
      fellers ain't watching it as close as they might. I was away over Dry
      Creek way yesterday, and I seen where there was two different fires got
      through the company's guards, and kited off across the country. It jest <i>happened</i>
      that the grass give out in that red day soil, and starved 'em both out.
      They wa'n't <i>put</i> out. I looked close all around, and there wasn't
      nary a track of man or horse. That's their business&mdash;ridin' line on
      the railroad. The section men's been workin' off down the other way, where
      a culvert got scorched up pretty bad. By granny, Fred 'n' Bill Madison
      spend might' nigh all their time ridin' the trail to town. They're might'
      p'ticular about watchin' the railroad between the switches&mdash;<i>he-he!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's something for the Double Diamond to worry over,&rdquo; Kent rebuffed. He
      hated that sort of gossip which must speak ill of somebody. &ldquo;Our winter
      range lays mostly south and east; we could stop a fire between here and
      the Double Diamond, even if they let one get past 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Polycarp regarded him cunningly with his little, slitlike eyes. &ldquo;Mebbe you
      could,&rdquo; he said doubtfully. &ldquo;And then again, mebbe you couldn't. Oncet it
      got past Cold Spring&mdash;&rdquo; He shook his wizened head slowly, leaned, and
      expectorated gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man Fleetwood's keeping tab pretty close over that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Polycarp gave a grunt that was half a chuckle. &ldquo;Man Fleetwood's keeping
      tab on what runs down his gullet,&rdquo; he corrected. &ldquo;I seen him an' his wife
      out burnin' guards t' other day&mdash;over on his west line&mdash;and, by
      granny, it wouldn't stop nothing! A toad could jump it&mdash;<i>he-he!</i>&rdquo;
       He sent another stream of tobacco juice afar, with the grave air as
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I told him so. 'Man,' I says, 'what you think you're doing?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Buildin' a fire guard,' he says. 'My wife, Mr. Jenks.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Polycarp Jenks is my cognomen,' I says. 'And I don't want no misterin'
      in mine. Polycarp's good enough for me,' I says, and I took off my hat and
      bowed to 'is wife. Funny kinda eyes, she's got&mdash;ever take notice?
      Yeller, by granny! first time I ever seen yeller eyes in a human's face.
      Mebbe it was the sun in 'em, but they sure was yeller. I dunno as they
      hurt her looks none, either. Kinda queer lookin', but when you git used to
      'em you kinda like 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'N' I says: 'Tain't half wide enough, nor a third'&mdash;spoke right up
      to 'im! I was thinkin' of the hull blamed country, and I didn't care how
      he took it. 'Any good, able-bodied wind'll jump a fire across that guard
      so quick it won't reelize there was any there,' I says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man didn't like it none too well, either. He says to me: 'That guard'll
      stop any fire I ever saw,' and I got right back at him&mdash;<i>he-he!</i>
      'Man,' I says, 'you ain't never saw a prairie fire'&mdash;just like that.
      'You wait,' I says, 'till the real thing comes along. We ain't had any
      fires since you come into the country,' I says, 'and you don't know what
      they're like. Now, you take my advice and plow another four or five
      furrows&mdash;and plow 'em out, seventy-five or a hundred feet from here,'
      I says, 'an' make sure you git all the grass burned off between&mdash;and
      do it on a still day,' I says. 'You'll burn up the hull country if you
      keep on this here way you're doing,' I told him&mdash;straight out, just
      like that. 'And when you do it,' I says, 'you better let somebody know,
      so's they can come an' help,' I says. ''Tain't any job a man oughta tackle
      alone,' I says to him. 'Git help, Man, git help.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, by granny&mdash;<i>he-he!</i> Man's wife brustled up at me like a&mdash;a&mdash;&rdquo;
       He searched his brain for a simile, and failed to find one. &ldquo;'I have been
      helping Manley, Mr. Polycarp Jenks,' she says to me, 'and I flatter myself
      I have done as well as any <i>man</i> could do.' And, by granny! the way
      them yeller eyes of hern blazed at me&mdash;<i>he-he!</i> I had to laugh,
      jest to look at her. Dressed jest like a city girl, by granny! with
      ruffles on her skirts&mdash;to ketch afire if she wasn't mighty keerful!&mdash;and
      a big straw hat tied down with a veil, and kid gloves on her hands, and
      her yeller hair kinda fallin' around her face&mdash;and them yeller eyes
      snappin' like flames&mdash;by granny! if she didn't make as purty a
      picture as I ever want to set eyes on! Slim and straight, jest like a
      storybook woman&mdash;<i>he-he!</i> 'Course, she was all smoke an' dirt; a
      big flake of burned grass was on her hair, I took notice, and them ruffles
      was black up to her knees&mdash;<i>he-he!</i> And she had a big smut on
      her cheek&mdash;but she was right there with her stack of blues, by
      granny! Settin' into the game like a&mdash;a&mdash;&rdquo; He leaned and spat
      &ldquo;But burnin' guards ain't no work for a woman to do, an' I told Man so&mdash;straight
      out. 'You git help,' I says. 'I see you're might' near through with this
      here strip,' I says, 'an' I'm in a hurry, or I'd stay, right now.' And, by
      granny! if that there wife of Man's didn't up an' hit me another biff&mdash;<i>he-he!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Thank you very much,' she says to me, like ice water. 'When we need your
      help, we'll be sure to let you know&mdash;but at present,' she says, 'we
      couldn't think of troubling you.' And then, by granny! she turns right
      around and smiles up at me&mdash;<i>he-he!</i> Made me feel like
      somebody'd tickled m' ear with a spear of hay when I was asleep, by
      granny! Never felt anything like it&mdash;not jest with somebody smilin'
      at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Polycarp Jenks,' she says to me, 'we do appreciate what you've told us,
      and I believe you're right,' she says. 'But don't insiniwate I'm not as
      good a fighter as any man who ever breathed,' she says. 'Manley has
      another of his headaches to-day&mdash;going to town always gives him a
      sick headache,' she says, 'and I've done nearly all of this my own, lone
      self,' she says. 'And I'm horribly proud of it, and I'll never forgive you
      for saying I&mdash;' And then, by granny! if she didn't begin to blink
      them eyes, and I felt like a&mdash;a&mdash;&rdquo; He put the usual period to
      his hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between you an' <i>me</i>, Kenneth,&rdquo; he added, looking at Kent slyly,
      &ldquo;she ain't having none too easy a time. Man's gone back to drinkin'&mdash;I
      knowed all the time he wouldn't stay braced up very long&mdash;lasted
      about six weeks, from all I c'n hear. Mebbe she reely thinks it's jest
      headaches ails him when he comes back from town&mdash;I dunno. You can't
      never tell what idees a woman's got tacked away under her hair&mdash;from
      all I c'n gether. I don't p'tend to know nothing about 'em&mdash;don't
      want to know&mdash;<i>he-he!</i> But I guess,&rdquo; he hinted cunningly, &ldquo;I
      know as much about 'em as you do&mdash;hey, Kenneth? You don't seem to
      chase after 'em none, yourself&mdash;<i>he-he!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whereabouts did Man run his guards?&rdquo; asked Kent, passing over the
      invitation to personal confessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polycarp gave a grunt of disdain. &ldquo;Just on the west rim of his coulee.
      About forty rod of six-foot guard, and slanted so it'll shoot a fire right
      into high grass at the head of the coulee and send it kitin' over this
      way. That's supposin' it turns a fire, which it won't. Six feet&mdash;a
      fall like this here! Why, I never see grass so thick on this range&mdash;did
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder, did he burn that extra guard?&rdquo; Kent was keeping himself rigidly
      to the subject of real importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by granny! he didn't&mdash;not unless he done it since yest'day. He
      went to town for suthin, and he might' nigh forgot to go home&mdash;<i>he-he!</i>
      He was there yest'day about three o'clock, an' I says to him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so-long; I got to, be moving.&rdquo; Kent gathered up the reins and went
      his way, leaving Polycarp just in the act of drawing his &ldquo;plug&rdquo; from his
      pocket, by his usual laborious method, in mental preparation for another
      half hour of talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you're ridin' over that way, Kenneth, you better take a look at Man's
      guard,&rdquo; he called after him. &ldquo;A good mile of guard, along there, would
      help a lot if a fire got started beyond. The way he fixed it, it ain't no
      account at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent proved by a gesture that he heard him, and rode on without turning to
      look back. Already his form was blurred as Polycarp gazed after him, and
      in another minute or two he was blotted out completely by the smoke veil,
      though he rode upon the level. Polycarp watched him craftily, though there
      was no need, until he was completely hidden, then he went on, ruminating
      upon the faults of his acquaintances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent had no intention of riding over to Cold Spring. He had not been there
      since Manley's marriage, though he had been a frequent visitor before, and
      unless necessity drove him there, it would be long before he faced again
      the antagonism of Mrs. Fleetwood. Still, he was mentally uncomfortable,
      and he felt much resentment against Polycarp Jenks because he had caused
      that discomfort. What was it to him, if Manley had gone bock to drinking?
      He asked the question more than once, and he answered always that it was
      nothing to him, of course. Still, he wished futilely that he had not been
      quite so eager to cover up Manley's weakness and deceive the girl. He
      ought to have given her a chance&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      A cinder like a huge black snowflake struck him suddenly upon the cheek.
      He looked up, startled, and tried to see farther into the haze which
      closed him round. It seemed to him, now that his mind was turned from his
      musings, that the smoke was thicker, the smell of burning grass stronger,
      and the breath of wind hotter upon his face. He turned, looked away to the
      west, fancied there a tumbled blackness new to his sight, and put his
      horse to a run. If there were fire close, then every second counted; and
      as he raced over the uneven prairie he fumbled with the saddle string that
      held a sodden sack tied fast to the saddle, that he might lose no time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cinders grew thicker, until the air was filled with them, like a
      snowstorm done in India ink. A little farther and he heard a faint
      crackling; topped a ridge and saw not far ahead, a dancing, yellow line.
      His horse was breathing heavily with the pace he was keeping, but Kent,
      swinging away from the onrush of flame and heat, spurred him to a greater
      speed. They neared the end of the crackling, red line, and as Kent swung
      in behind it upon the burned ground, he saw several men beating steadily
      at the flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was hardly at work when Polycarp came running up and took his place
      beside him; but beyond that Kent paid no attention to the others, though
      he heard and recognized the voice of Fred De Garmo calling out to some
      one. The smoke which rolled up in uneven volumes as the wind lifted it and
      bore it away, or let it suck backward as it veered for an instant, blinded
      him while he fought. He heard other men gallop up, and after a little some
      one clattered up with a wagon filled with barrels of water. He ran to wet
      his sack, and saw that it was Blumenthall himself, foreman of the Double
      Diamond, who drove the team.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky it ain't as windy as it was yesterday and the day before,&rdquo;
       Blumenthall cried out, as Kent stepped upon the brake block to reach a
      barrel. &ldquo;It'd sweep the whole country if it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent nodded, and ran back to the fire, trailing the dripping sack after
      him. As he passed Polycarp and another, he heard Polycarp saying something
      about Man Fleetwood's fire guard; but he did not stop to hear what it was.
      Polycarp was always talking, and he didn't always keep too closely to
      facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, of a sudden, he saw men dimly when he glanced down the leaping fire
      line, and he knew that the fire was almost conquered. Another frenzied
      minute or two, and he was standing in a group of men, who dropped their
      charred, blackened fragments of blanket and bags, and began to feel for
      their smoking material, while they stamped upon stray embers which looked
      live enough to be dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she's out,&rdquo; said a voice, &ldquo;But it did look for a while as if it'd
      get away in spite of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent turned away, wiping an eye which held a cinder fast under the lid. It
      was Fred De Garmo who spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If somebody'd been watchin' the railroad a leetle might closer&mdash;&rdquo;
       Polycarp began, in his thin, rasping voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred cut him short. &ldquo;I thought you laid it to Man Fleetwood, burning fire
      guards,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;Keep on, and you'll get it right pretty soon. This
      never come from the railroad; you can gamble on that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blumenthall had left his team and come among them. &ldquo;If you want to know
      how it started, I can tell you. Somebody dropped a match, or a cigarette,
      or something, by the trail up here a ways. I saw where it started when I
      went to Cold Spring after the last load of water. And if I knew who it was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Polycarp launched his opinion first, as usual. &ldquo;Well, I don't <i>know</i>
      who done it&mdash;but, by granny! I can might' nigh guess who it was.
      There's jest one man that I know of been traveling that trail lately when
      he wa'n't in his sober senses&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Manley Fleetwood rode up to them, coughing at the soot his horse
      kicked up. &ldquo;Say! you fellows come on over to the house and have something
      to eat&mdash;and,&rdquo; he added significantly, &ldquo;something <i>wet</i>. I told
      my wife, when I saw the fire, to make plenty of coffee, for fighting
      fire's hungry work, let me tell. Come on&mdash;no hanging back, you know.
      There'll be lots of coffee, and I've got a quart of something better
      cached in the haystack!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he had said, fighting fire is hungry work, and none save Blumenthall,
      who was dyspeptic and only ate twice a day, and then of certain foods
      prepared by himself, declined the invitation.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. VAL'S NEW DUTIES
    </h2>
    <p>
      To Val the days of heat and smoke, and the isolation, had made life seem
      unreal, like a dream which holds one fast and yet is absurd and utterly
      improbable. Her past was pushed so far from her that she could not even
      long for it as she had done during the first few weeks. There were nights
      of utter desolation, when Manley was in town upon some errand which
      prevented his speedy return&mdash;nights when the coyotes howled much
      louder than usual, and she could not sleep for the mysterious snapping and
      creaking about the shack, but lay shivering with fear until dawn; but not
      for worlds would she have admitted to Manley her dread of staying alone.
      She believed it to be necessary, or he would not require it of her, and
      she wanted to be all that he expected her to be. She was very sensitive,
      in those days, about doing her whole duty as a wife&mdash;the wife of a
      Western rancher.
    </p>
    <p>
      For that reason, when Manley shouted to her the news of the fire as he
      galloped past the shack, and told her to have something for the men to eat
      when the fire was out, she never thought of demurring, or explaining to
      him that there was scarcely any wood, and that she could not cook a meal
      without fuel. Instead, she waved her hand to him and let him go; and when
      he was quite out of sight she went up to the corrals to see if she could
      find another useless pole, or a broken board or two which her slight
      strength would be sufficient to break up with the axe. Till she came to
      Montana, Val had never taken an axe in her hands; but its use was only one
      of the many things she must learn, of which she had all her life been
      ignorant.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an old post there, lying beside a rusty, overturned plow. More
      than once she had stopped and eyed it speculatively, and the day before
      she had gone so far as to lift an end of it tentatively; but she had found
      it very heavy, and she had also disturbed a lot of black bugs that went
      scurrying here and there, so that she was forced to gather her skirts
      close about her and run for her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where Manley had built his hayrack she had yesterday discovered some ends
      of planking hidden away in the rank, ripened weeds and grass. She went
      there now, but there were no more, look closely as she might. She circled
      the evil-smelling stable in discouragement, picked up one short piece of
      rotten board, and came back to the post. As she neared it she
      involuntarily caught her skirts and held them close, in terror of the
      black bugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      She eyed it with extreme disfavor, and finally ventured to poke it with
      her slipper toe; one lone bug scuttled out and away in the tall weeds.
      With the piece of board she turned it over, stared hard at the yellowed
      grass beneath, discovered nothing so very terrifying after all, and, in
      pure desperation, dragged the post laboriously down to the place where had
      been the woodpile. Then, lifting the heavy axe, she went awkwardly to work
      upon it, and actually succeeded, in the course of half an hour or so, in
      worrying an armful of splinters off it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started a fire, and then she had to take the big zinc pail and carry
      some water down from the spring before she could really begin to cook
      anything. Manley's work, every bit of it&mdash;but then Manley was so very
      busy, and he couldn't remember all these little things, and Val hated to
      keep reminding him. Theoretically, Manley objected to her chopping wood or
      carrying water, and always seemed to feel a personal resentment when he
      discovered her doing it. Practically, however, he was more and more often
      making it necessary for her to do these things.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is why he returned with the fire fighters and found Val just laying
      the cloth upon the table, which she had moved into the front room so that
      there would be space to seat her guests at all four sides. He frowned when
      he looked in and saw that they must wait indefinitely, and her cheeks took
      on a deeper shade of pink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything will be ready in ten minutes,&rdquo; she hurriedly assured him. &ldquo;How
      many are there, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight, counting myself,&rdquo; he answered gruffly. &ldquo;Get some clean towels, and
      we'll go up to the spring to wash; and try and have dinner ready when we
      get back&mdash;we're half starved.&rdquo; With the towels over his arm, he led
      the way up to the spring. He must have taken the trail which led past the
      haystack, for he returned in much better humor, and introduced the men to
      his wife with the genial air of a host who loves to entertain largely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val stood back and watched them file in to the table and seat themselves
      with a noisy confusion. Unpolished they were, in clothes and manner,
      though she dimly appreciated the way in which they refrained from looking
      at her too intently, and the conscious lowering of their voices while they
      talked among themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did, however, glance at her surreptitiously while she was moving
      quietly about, with her flushed cheeks and her yellow-brown hair falling
      becomingly down at the temples because she had not found a spare minute in
      which to brush it smooth, and her dainty dress and crisp, white apron. She
      was not like the women they were accustomed to meet, and they paid her the
      high tribute of being embarrassed by her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She poured coffee until all the cups were full, replenished the bread
      plate and brought more butter, and hunted the kitchen over for the can
      opener, to punch little holes in another can of condensed cream; and she
      rather astonished her guests by serving it in a beautiful cut-glass
      pitcher instead of the can in which it was bought.
    </p>
    <p>
      They handled the pitcher awkwardly because of their mental uneasiness, and
      Val shared with them their fear of breaking it, and was guilty of an
      audible sigh of relief when at last it found safety upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      So perturbed was she that even when she decided that she could do no more
      for their comfort and retreated to the kitchen, she failed to realize that
      the one extra plate meant an absent guest, and not a miscount in placing
      them, as she fancied.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remembered that she would need plenty of hot water to wash all those
      dishes, and the zinc pail was empty; it always was, it seemed to her, no
      matter how often she filed it. She took the tin dipper out of it, so that
      it would not rattle and betray her purpose to Manley, sitting just inside
      the door with his back toward her, and tiptoed quite guiltily out of the
      kitchen. Once well away from the shack, she ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      She reached the spring quite out of breath, and she actually bumped into a
      man who stood carefully rinsing a bloodstained handkerchief under the
      overflow from the horse trough. She gave a little scream, and the pail
      went rolling noisily down the steep bank and lay on its side in the mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent turned and looked at her, himself rather startled by the unexpected
      collision. Involuntarily he threw out his hand to steady her. &ldquo;How do you
      do, Mrs. Fleetwood?&rdquo; he said, with all the composure he could muster to
      his aid. &ldquo;I'm afraid I scared you. My nose got to bleeding&mdash;with the
      heat, I guess. I just now managed to stop it.&rdquo; He did not consider it
      necessary to explain his presence, but he did feel that talking would help
      her recover her breath and her color. &ldquo;It's a plumb nuisance to have the
      nosebleed so much,&rdquo; he added plaintively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val was still trembling and staring at him with her odd, yellow-brown
      eyes. He glanced at her swiftly, and then bent to squeeze the water from
      his handkerchief; but his trained eyes saw her in all her dainty
      allurement; saw how the coppery sunlight gave a strange glint to her hair,
      and how her eyes almost matched it in color, and how the pupils had
      widened with fright. He saw, too, something wistful in her face, as though
      life was none too kind to her, and she had not yet abandoned her first
      sensation of pained surprise that it should treat her so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I get for running,&rdquo; she said, still panting a little as she
      watched him. &ldquo;I thought all the men were at the table, you see. Your
      dinner will be cold, Mr. Burnett.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent was a bit surprised at the absence of cold hauteur in her manner; his
      memory of her had been so different.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm used to cold grub,&rdquo; he smiled over his shoulder. &ldquo;And, anyway,
      when your nose gets to acting up with you, it's like riding a pitching
      horse; you've got to pass up everything and give it all your time and
      attention.&rdquo; Then, with the daring that sometimes possessed him like a
      devil, he looked straight at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure you intend to give me my dinner?&rdquo; he quizzed, his lips' lifting
      humorously at the corners. &ldquo;I kinda thought, from the way you turned me
      down cold when we met before, you'd shut your door in my face if I came
      pestering around. How <i>about</i> that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little flames of light nickered in her eyes. &ldquo;You are the guest of my
      husband, here by his invitation,&rdquo; she answered him coldly. &ldquo;Of course I
      shall give you your dinner, if you want any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He inspected his handkerchief critically, decided that it was not quite
      clean, and held it again under the stream of water. &ldquo;If I want it&mdash;yes,&rdquo;
       he drawled maliciously. &ldquo;Maybe I'm not sure about that part. Are you a
      pretty fair cook?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you'd better interview your friends,&rdquo; she retorted, &ldquo;if you are
      so very fastidious. I&mdash;&rdquo; She drew her brows together, as if she was
      in doubt as to the proper method of dealing with this impertinence. She
      suspected that he was teasing her purposely, but still&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can eat 'most any old thing,&rdquo; he assured her, with calm effrontery.
      &ldquo;You look as if you'd learn easy, and Man ain't the worst cook I ever ate
      after. If he's trained you faithful, maybe it'll be safe to take a change.
      How <i>about</i> that? Can you make sour-dough bread yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she flung the word at him. &ldquo;And I don't want to learn,&rdquo; she added,
      at the expense of her dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent shook his head disapprovingly. &ldquo;That sure ain't the proper spirit to
      show,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;Man must have to beat you up a good deal, if you
      talk back to <i>him</i> that way.&rdquo; He eyed her sidelong. &ldquo;You're a real
      little wolf, aren't you?&rdquo; He shook his head again solemnly, and sighed. &ldquo;A
      fellow sure must build himself lots of trouble when he annexes a wife&mdash;a
      wife that won't learn to make sour-dough bread, and that talks back. I'm
      plumb sorry for Man. We used to be pretty good friends&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped
      short, his face contrite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val was looking away, and she was winking very fast. Also, her lips were
      quivering unmistakably, though she was biting them to keep them steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent stared at her helplessly. &ldquo;Say! I never thought you'd mind a little
      joshing,&rdquo; he said gently, when the silence was growing awkward. &ldquo;I ought
      to be killed! You&mdash;you must get awful lonesome&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her face toward him quickly, as if he were the first person who
      had understood her blank loneliness. &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she told him, in an odd,
      hesitating manner, &ldquo;atones for the&mdash;the 'joshing.' No one seems to
      realize&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you get out and ride around, or do something beside stick right
      here in this coulee like a&mdash;a cactus?&rdquo; he demanded, with a roughness
      that somehow was grateful to her. &ldquo;I'll bet you haven't been a mile from
      the ranch since Man brought you here. Why don't you go to town with him
      when he goes? It'd be a whole lot better for you&mdash;for both of you.
      Have you got acquainted with any of the women here yet? I'll gamble you
      haven't!&rdquo; He was waving the handkerchief gently like a flag, to dry it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val watched him; she had never seen any one hold a handkerchief by the
      corners and wave it up and down like that for quick drying, and the
      expedient interested her, even while she was wondering if it was quite
      proper for him to lecture her in that manner. His scolding was even more
      confusing than his teasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been down to the river twice,&rdquo; she defended weakly, and was angry
      with herself that she could not find words with which to quell him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; He down at her indulgently. &ldquo;How did you ever manage to get so
      far? It must be all of half a mile!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you're perfectly horrible!&rdquo; she flashed suddenly. &ldquo;I don't see how it
      can possibly concern you whether I go anywhere or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does, though. I'm a lot public-spirited. I hate to see taxes go up,
      and every lunatic that goes to the asylum costs the State just that much
      more. I don't know an easier recipe for going crazy than just to stay off
      alone and think. It's a fright the way it gets sheep-herders, and such.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm <i>such</i>, I suppose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent glanced at her, approved mentally of the color in her cheeks and the
      angry light in her eyes, and laughed at her quite openly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing like getting good and mad once in a while, to take the
      kinks out of your brain,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;And there's nothing like
      lonesomeness to put 'em in. A good fighting mad is what you need, now and
      then; I'll have to put Man next, I guess. He's too mild.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one could accuse you of that,&rdquo; she retorted, laughing a little in
      spite of herself. &ldquo;If I were a man I should want to blacken your eyes&mdash;&rdquo;
       And she blushed hotly at being betrayed into a personality which seemed to
      her undignified, and, what was worse, unrefined. She turned her back
      squarely toward him, started down the path, and remembered that she had
      not filled the water bucket, and that without it she could not
      consistently return to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent interpreted her glance, went sliding down the steep bank and
      recovered the pail; he was laughing to himself while he rinsed and filled
      it at the spring, but he made no effort to explain his amusement. When he
      came back to where she stood watching him, Val gave her head a slight
      downward tilt to indicate her thanks, turned, and led the way back to the
      house without a word. And he, following after, watched her slim figure
      swinging lightly down the hill before him, and wondered vaguely what sort
      of a hell her life was going to be, out here where everything was
      different from what she had been accustomed to, and where she did not seem
      to &ldquo;fit into the scenery,&rdquo; as he put it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to learn to ride horseback,&rdquo; he advised unexpectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me&mdash;you ought to learn to wait until your advice is wanted,&rdquo;
       she replied calmly, without turning her head. And she added, with a sort
      of defiance: &ldquo;I do not feel the need of either society or diversion, I
      assure you; I am perfectly contented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's real nice,&rdquo; he approved. &ldquo;There's nothing like being satisfied
      with what's handed out to you.&rdquo; But, though he spoke with much unconcern,
      his tone betrayed his skepticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others had finished eating and were sitting upon their heels in the
      shade of the house, smoking and talking in that desultory fashion common
      to men just after a good meal. Two or three glanced rather curiously at
      Kent and his companion, and he detected the covert smile on the
      scandal-hungry face of Polycarp Jenks, and also the amused twist of Fred
      De Garmo's lips. He went past them without a sign of understanding, set
      the water pail down in its proper place upon a bench inside the kitchen
      door, tilted his hat to Val, who happened to be looking toward him at that
      moment, and went out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the hurry, Kenneth?&rdquo; quizzed Polycarp, when Kent started toward
      the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow my trail long enough and you'll find out&mdash;maybe,&rdquo; Kent
      snapped in reply. He felt that the whole group was watching hum, and he
      knew that if he looked back and caught another glimpse of Fred De Garmo's
      sneering face he would feel compelled to strike it a blow. There would be
      no plausible explanation, of course, and Kent was not by nature a trouble
      hunter; and so he chose to ride away without his dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Polycarp was still wondering audibly what was the matter, Kent
      passed the house on his gray, called &ldquo;So-long, Man,&rdquo; with scarcely a
      glance at his host, and speedily became a dim figure in the smoke haze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be runnin' away from you, Fred,&rdquo; Polycarp hinted, grinning
      cunningly. &ldquo;What you done to him&mdash;hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fred answered him with an unsatisfactory scowl. &ldquo;You sure would be wise,
      if you found out everything you wanted to know,&rdquo; he said contemptuously,
      after an appreciable Wait. &ldquo;I guess we better be moving along, Bill.&rdquo; He
      rose, brushed off his trousers with a downward sweep of his hands, and
      strolled toward the corrals, followed languidly by Bill Madison.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if they had been waiting for a leader, the others rose also and
      prepared to depart. Polycarp proceeded, in his usual laborious manner, to
      draw his tobacco from his pocket, and pry off a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you burn them guards now, Manley, while you got plenty of
      help?&rdquo; he suggested, turning his slit-lidded eyes toward the kitchen door,
      where Val appeared for an instant to reach the broom which stood outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I don't want to,&rdquo; snapped Manley: &ldquo;I've got plenty to do without
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they ain't wide enough, nor long enough, and they don't run in the
      right direction&mdash;if you ask me.&rdquo; Polycarp spat solemnly off to the
      right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't ask you, as it happens.&rdquo; Manley turned and went into the home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polycarp looked quizzically at the closed door. &ldquo;He's mighty touchy about
      them guards, for a feller that thinks they're all right&mdash;<i>he-he!</i>&rdquo;
       he remarked, to no one in particular. &ldquo;Some of these days, by granny,
      he'll wisht he'd took my advice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Since no one gave him the slightest attention, Polycarp did not pursue the
      subject further. Instead, with both ears open to catch all that was said,
      he trailed after the others to the corral. It was a matter of instinct, as
      well as principle, with Polycarp Jenks, to let no sentence, however
      trivial, slip past his hearing and his memory.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. THE PRAIRIE FIRE
    </h2>
    <p>
      A calamity expected, feared, and guarded against by a whole community does
      sometimes occur, and with a suddenness which finds the victims unprepared
      in spite of all their elaborate precautions. Compared with the importance
      of saving the range from fire, it was but a trivial thing which took
      nearly every man who dwelt in Lonesome Land to town on a certain day when
      the wind blew free from out the west. They were weary of watching for the
      fire which did not come licking through the prairie grass, and a special
      campaign train bearing a prospective President of our United States was
      expected to pass through Hope that afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since all trains watered at the red tank by the creek, there would be a
      five-minute stop, during which the prospective President would stand upon
      the rear platform and deliver a three-minute address&mdash;a few gracious
      words to tickle the self-esteem of his listeners&mdash;and would employ
      the other two minutes in shaking the hand of every man, woman, and child
      who could reach him before the train pulled out. There would be a cheer or
      two given as he was borne away&mdash;and there would be something to talk
      about afterward in the saloons. Scarce a man of then had ever seen a
      President, and it was worth riding far to look upon a man who even hoped
      for so exalted a position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manley went because he intended to vote for the man, and called it an act
      of loyalty to his party to greet the candidate; also because it took very
      little, now that haying was over and work did not press, to start him down
      the trail in the direction of Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Blumenthall ranch no man save the cook remained at home, and he
      only because he had a boil on his neck which sapped his interest in all
      things else. Polycarp Jenks was in town by nine o'clock, and only one man
      remained at the Wishbone. That man was Kent, and he stayed because,
      according to his outraged companions, he was an ornery cuss, and his bump
      of patriotism was a hollow in his skull. Kent had told them, one and all,
      that he wouldn't ride twenty-five miles to shake hands with the Deity
      Himself&mdash;which, however, is not a verbatim report of his statement.
      The prospective President had not done anything so big, he said, that a
      man should want to break his neck getting to town just to watch him go by.
      He was dead sure he, for one, wasn't going to make a fool of himself over
      any swell-headed politician.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, he saddled and rode with his fellows for a mile or two, and called
      them unseemly names in a facetious tone; and the men of the Wishbone
      answered his taunts with shrill yells of derision when he swung out of the
      trail and jogged away to the south, and finally passed out of sight in the
      haze which still hung depressingly over the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oddly enough, while all the able-bodied men save Kent were waiting
      hilariously in Hope to greet, with enthusiasm, the brief presence of the
      man who would fain be their political chief, the train which bore him
      eastward scattered fiery destruction abroad as it sped across their range,
      four minutes late and straining to make up the time before the next stop.
    </p>

      They had thought the railroad safe at last, what with the guards and the
      numerous burned patches where the fire had jumped the plowed boundary and
      blackened the earth to the fence which marked the line of the right of
      way, and, in some places, had burned beyond. It took a flag-flying special
      train of that bitter Presidential campaign to find a weak spot in the
      guard, and to send a spark straight into the thickest bunch of wiry sand
      grass, where the wind could fan it to a blaze and then seize it and bend
      the tall flame tongues until they licked around the next tuft of grass,
      and the next, and the next&mdash;until the spark was grown to a long,
      leaping line of fire, sweeping eastward with the relentless rush of a
      tidal wave upon a low-lying beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arline Hawley was, perhaps, the only citizen of Hope who had deliberately
      chosen to absent herself from the crowd standing, in perspiring
      expectation, upon the depot platform. She had permitted Minnie, the
      &ldquo;breed&rdquo; girl, to go, and had even grudgingly consented to her using a box
      of cornstarch as first aid to her complexion. Arline had not approved,
      however, of either the complexion or the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you want to go and plaster your face up with starch for, gits me,&rdquo;
       she had criticised frankly. &ldquo;Seems to me you're homely enough without
      lookin' silly, into the bargain. Nobody's going to look at you, no matter
      what you do. They're out to rubber at a higher mark than you be. And what
      they expect to see so great, gits me. He ain't nothing but a man&mdash;and,
      land knows, men is common enough, and ornery enough, without runnin' like
      a band of sheep to see one. I don't see as he's any better, jest because
      he's runnin' for President; if he gits beat, he'll want to hide his head
      in a hole in the ground. Look at my Walt. <i>He</i> was the biggest man in
      Hope, and so swell-headed he wouldn't so much as pack a bucket of water
      all fall, or chop up a tie for kindlin'&mdash;till the day after 'lection.
      And what was he then but a frazzled-out back number, that everybody give
      the laugh&mdash;till he up and blowed his brains out! Any fool can <i>run</i>
      for President&mdash;it's the feller that gits there that counts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, that red-white-'n'-blue ribbon sure looks fierce on that green dress&mdash;but
      I reckon blood will tell, even if it's Injun blood. G'wan, or you'll be
      late and have your trouble for your pay. But hurry back soon's the agony's
      over; the bread'll be ready to mix out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even after the girl was gone, her finery a-flutter in the sweeping west
      wind, Arline muttered aloud her opinion of men, and particularly of
      politicians who rode about in special trains and expected the homage of
      their fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was in the back yard, taking her &ldquo;white clothes&rdquo; off the line, when
      the special came puffing slowly into town. To emphasize her disapproval of
      the whole system of politics, she turned her back square toward it, and
      laid violent hold of a sheet. There was a smudge of cinders upon its white
      surface, and it crushed crisply under her thumb with the unmistakable feel
      of burned grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what in time&mdash;&rdquo; began Arline aloud, after the manner of women
      whose tongues must keep pace with their thoughts. &ldquo;That there feels fresh
      and&rdquo;&mdash;with a sniff at the spot&mdash;&ldquo;<i>smells</i> fresh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the wisdom of much experience she faced the hot wind and sniffed
      again, while her eyes searched keenly the sky line, which was the ragged
      top of the bluff marking the northern boundary of the great prairie land.
      A trifle darker it was there, and there was a certain sullen glow
      discernible only to eyes trained to read the sky for warning signals of
      snow, fire, and flood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a fire, and it's this side of the river. And if it is, then the
      railroad set it, and there ain't a livin' thing to stop it. An' the wind's
      jest right&mdash;&rdquo; A curdled roll of smoke showed plainly for a moment in
      the haze. She crammed her armful of sheets into the battered willow
      basket, threw two clothespins hastily toward the same receptacle, and ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      The special had just come to a stop at the depot. The cattlemen, cowboys,
      and townspeople were packed close around the rear of the train, their
      backs to the wind and the disaster sweeping down upon them, their browned
      faces upturned to the sleek, carefully groomed man in the light-gray suit,
      with a flaunting, prairie sunflower ostentatiously displayed in his
      buttonhole and with his campaign smile upon his lips and dull boredom
      looking out of his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; he was saying, as he smiled, &ldquo;you favoured ones
      whose happy lot it is to live in the most glorious State of our glorious
      union, I greet you, and I envy you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arline, with her soiled kitchen apron, her ragged coil of dust-brown hair,
      her work-drawn face and faded eyes which blazed with excitement, pushed
      unceremoniously through the crowd and confronted him undazzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mister Candidate, you better move on and give these men a chancet to save
      their prope'ty,&rdquo; she cried shrilly. &ldquo;They got something to do besides
      stand around here and listen at you throwin' campaign loads. The hull
      country's afire back of us, and the wind bringin' it down on a long lope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned from the astounded candidate and glared at the startled crowd,
      every one of whom she knew personally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must say I got my opinion of a bunch that'll stand here swallowin' a
      lot of hot air, while their coat tails is most ready to ketch afire!&rdquo; Her
      voice was rasping, and it carried to the farthest of them. &ldquo;You make me <i>tired!</i>
      Political slush, all of it&mdash;and the hull darned country a-blazin'
      behind you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowd moved uneasily, then scattered away from the shelter of the
      depot to where they could snuff inquiringly the wind, like dogs in the
      leash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right,&rdquo; yelled Blumenthall, of the Double Diamond. &ldquo;There's a
      fire, sure as hell!&rdquo; He started to run.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man behind him hesitated but a second, then gripped his hat against
      the push of the wind, and began running. Presently men, women, and
      children were running, all in one direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prospective President stood agape upon the platform of his
      bunting-draped car, his chosen allies grouped foolishly around him. It was
      the first time men had turned from his presence with his gracious,
      flatteringly noncommittal speech unuttered, his hand unshaken, his
      smiling, bowing departure unmarked by cheers growing fainter as he
      receded. Only Arline tarried, her thin fingers gripping the arm of her
      &ldquo;breed girl,&rdquo; lest she catch the panic and run with the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arline tilted back her head upon her scrawny shoulders and eyed the
      prospective President with antagonism unconcealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got something to say to you before you go,&rdquo; she announced, in her
      rasping voice, with its querulous note. &ldquo;I want to tell you that the
      chances are a hundred to one you set that fire yourself, with your engine
      that's haulin' you around over the country, so you can jolly men into
      votin' for you. Your train's the only one over the road since noon, and
      that fire started from the railroad. The hull town's liable to burn,
      unless it can be stopped the other side the creek, to say nothing of the
      range, that feeds our stock, and the hay, and maybe houses&mdash;and maybe
      <i>people!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She caught her breath, and almost shrieked the last three words, as a
      dreadful probability flashed into her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know a woman&mdash;just a girl&mdash;and she's back there twenty mile&mdash;<i>alone</i>,
      and her man's here to look at you go by! I hope you git beat, just for
      that!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this town ketches afire and burns up, I hope you run into the ditch
      before you git ten mile! If you was a man, and them fellers with you was
      men, you'd hold up your train and help save the town. Every feller counts,
      when it comes to fightin' fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped and eyed the group keenly. &ldquo;But you won't. I don't reckon you
      ever done anything with them hands in your life that would grind a little
      honest dirt into your knuckles and under them shiny nails!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prospective President turned red to his ears, and hastily removed his
      immaculate hands from where they had been resting upon the railing. And he
      did not hold up the train while he and his allies stopped to help save the
      town. The whistle gave a warning toot, the bell jangled, and the train
      slid away toward the next town, leaving Arline staring, tight-lipped,
      after it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The darned chump&mdash;he'd 'a' made votes hand over fist if he'd called
      my bluff; but, I knew he wouldn't, soon as I seen his face. He ain't man
      enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's real good-lookin',&rdquo; sighed Minnie, feebly attempting to release her
      arm from the grasp of her mistress. &ldquo;And did you notice the fellow with
      the big yellow mustache? He kept eyin' me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't wonder&mdash;but it ain't anything to your credit,&rdquo; snapped
      Arline, facing her toward the hotel, &ldquo;You do look like sin a-flyin', in
      that green dress, and with all that starch on your face. You git along to
      the house and mix that bread, first thing you do, and start a fire. And if
      I ain't back by that time, you go ahead with the supper; you know what to
      git. We're liable to have all the tables full, so you set all of 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was hurrying away, when the girl called to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you mean Mis' Fleetwood, when you said that about the woman burning?
      And do you s'pose she's really in the fire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shut up and go along!&rdquo; cried Arline roughly, under the stress of her
      own fears. &ldquo;How in time's anybody going to tell, that's twenty miles
      away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She left the street and went hurrying through back yards and across vacant
      lots, crawled through a wire fence, and so reached, without any roundabout
      method, the trail which led to the top of the bluff, where the whole town
      was breathlessly assembling. Her flat-chested, un-corseted figure merged
      into the haze as she half trotted up the steep road, swinging her arms
      like a man, her skirts flapping in the wind. As she went, she kept
      muttering to herself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she really is caught by the fire&mdash;and her alone&mdash;and Man
      more'n half drunk&mdash;&rdquo; She whirled, and stood waiting for the horseman
      who was galloping up the trail behind her. &ldquo;You going home, Man? You don't
      think it could git to your place, do you?&rdquo; She shouted the questions at
      him as he pounded past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manley, sallow white with terror, shook his head vaguely and swung his
      heavy quirt down upon the flanks of his horse. Arline lowered her head
      against the dust kicked into her face as he went tearing past her, and
      kept doggedly on. Some one came rattling up behind her with empty barrels
      dancing erratically in a wagon, and she left the trail to make room. The
      hostler from their own stable it was who drove, and at the creek ahead of
      them he stopped to fill the barrels. Arline passed him by and kept on.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the brow of the hill the women and children were gathered in a
      whimpering group. Arline joined them and gazed out over the prairie, where
      the smoke was rolling toward them, and, lifting here and there, let a
      flare of yellow through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It'll show up fine at dark,&rdquo; a fat woman in a buggy remarked. &ldquo;There's
      nothing grander to look at than a prairie fire at night. I do hope,&rdquo; she
      added weakly, &ldquo;it don't do no great damage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it won't,&rdquo; Arline cut in, with savage sarcasm, panting from her
      climb. &ldquo;It's bound to sweep the hull country slick an' clean, and maybe
      burn us all out&mdash;but that won't matter, so long as it looks purty
      after dark!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say it's a good ten mile away yet,&rdquo; another woman volunteered
      encouragingly. &ldquo;They'll git it stopped, all right. There's lots of men
      here to fight it, thank goodness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arline moved on to where a plow was being hurriedly unloaded from a wagon,
      the horses hitched to it, and a man already grasping the handles in an
      aggressive manner. As she came up he went off, yelling his opinions and
      turning a shallow, uneven furrow for a back fire. Within five minutes
      another plow was tearing up the sod in an opposite direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it jumps here, or they can't turn it, the creek'll help a lot,&rdquo; some
      one was yelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plowed furrows lengthened, the horses sweating and throwing their
      heads up and down with the discomfort of the pace they must keep.
      Whiplashes whistled and the drivers urged them on with much shouting.
      Blumenthall, cut off, with his men, from reaching his own ranch, was
      directing a group about to set a back fire. His voice boomed as if he were
      shouting across a milling herd. A roll of his eye brought his attention
      momentarily from the work, and he ran toward a horseman who was
      gesticulating wildly and seemed on the point of riding straight toward the
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi! Fleetwood, we need you here!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;You can't get home now, and
      you know it. The fire's past your place already; you'd have to ride
      through it, you fool! Hey? Your wife home alone&mdash;<i>alone!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood absolutely still and stared out to the southwest, where the smoke
      cloud was rolling closer with every breath. He drew his fingers across his
      forehead and glanced at the men around him, also stunned into inactivity
      by the tragedy behind the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;get to work, men. We've got to save the town. Fine time to
      burn guards&mdash;when a fire's loping up on you! But that's the way it
      goes, generally. This ought to've been done a month ago. Put it off and
      put it off&mdash;while they haggle over bids&mdash;Brinberg, you and I'll
      string the fire. The rest of you watch it don't jump back. And, say!&rdquo; he
      shouted to the group around Manley. &ldquo;Don't let that crazy fool start off
      now. Put him to work. Best thing for him. But&mdash;my God, that's awful!&rdquo;
       He did not shout the last sentence. He spoke so that only the nearest man
      heard him&mdash;heard, and nodded dumb assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manley raged, sitting helpless there upon his horse. They would not let
      him ride out toward that sweeping wave of fire. He could not have gone
      five miles toward home before he met the flames. He stood in the stirrups
      and shook his fists impotently. He strained his eyes to see what it was
      impossible for him to see&mdash;his ranch and Val, and how they had fared.
      He pictured mentally the guard he had burned beyond the coulee to protect
      them from just this danger, and his heart squeezed tight at the
      realization of his own shiftlessness. That guard! A twelve-foot strip of
      half-burned sod, with tufts of grass left standing here and there&mdash;and
      he had meant to burn it wider, and had put it off from day to day, until
      now. <i>Now!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      His clenched fist dropped upon the saddle horn, and he stared dully at the
      rushing, rolling smoke and fire. It was not <i>that</i> he saw&mdash;it
      was Val, with cinder-blackened ruffles, grimy face, and yellow hair
      falling in loose locks upon her cheeks&mdash;locks which she must stop to
      push out of her eyes, so that she could see where to swing the sodden sack
      while she helped him&mdash;him, Manley, who had permitted her to do work
      it for none but a man's hard muscles, so that he might finish the sooner
      and ride to town upon some flimsy pretext. And he could not even reach her
      now&mdash;or the place where she had been!
    </p>
    <p>
      The group had thinned around him, for there was something to do besides
      give sympathy to a man bereaved. Unless they bestirred themselves, they
      might all be in need of sympathy before the day was done. Manley took his
      eyes from the coming fire and glanced around him, saw that he was alone,
      and, with a despairing oath, wheeled his horse and raced back down the
      hill to town, as if fiends rode behind the saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the saloon opposite the Hawley Hotel he drew up; rather, his horse
      stopped there of his own accord, as if he were quite at home at that
      particular hitching pole. Manley dismounted heavily and lurched inside.
      The place was deserted save for Jim, who was paid to watch the wares of
      his employer, and was now standing upon a chair at the window, that he
      might see over the top of Hawley's coal shed and glimpse the hilltop
      beyond. Jim stepped down and came toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's the fire?&rdquo; he demanded anxiously. &ldquo;Think she'll swing over this
      way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Manley had sunk into a chair and buried his face in his arms, folded
      upon a whisky-spotted card table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Val&mdash;my Val!&rdquo; he wailed, &ldquo;Back there alone&mdash;get me a drink,&rdquo; he
      added thickly, &ldquo;or I'll go crazy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim hastily poured a full glass, and stood over him anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is. Drink 'er down, and brace up. What you mean? Is your wife&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manley lifted his head long enough to gulp the whisky, then dropped it
      again upon his arms and groaned.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. KENT TO THE RESCUE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The fire had been burning a possible half-hour when Kent, jogging
      aimlessly toward a log ridge with the lazy notion of riding to the top and
      taking a look at the country to the west before returning to the ranch,
      first smelled the stronger tang of burned grass and swung instinctively
      into the wind. He galloped to higher ground, and, trained by long watching
      of the prairie to detect the smoke of a nearer fire in the haze of those
      long distant, saw at once what must have happened, and knew also the
      danger. His horse was fresh, and he raced him over the uneven prairie
      toward the blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was tearing straight across the high ground between Dry Creek and Cold
      Spring Coulee when he first saw it plainly, and he altered his course a
      trifle. The roar of it came faintly on the wind, like the sound of
      storm-beaten surf pounding heavily upon a sand bar when the tide is out,
      except that this roar was continuous, and was full of sharp cracklings and
      sputterings; and there was also the red line of flame to visualize the
      sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his eyes first swept the mile-long blaze, he felt his helplessness,
      and cursed aloud the man who had drawn all the fighting force from the
      prairie that day. They might at least have been able to harry it and
      hamper it and turn the savage sweep of it into barren ground upon some
      rock-bound coulee's rim. If they could have caught it at the start, or
      even in the first mile of its burning&mdash;or, even now, if Blumenthall's
      outfit were on the spot&mdash;or if Manley Fleetwood's fire guards held it
      back&mdash;He hoped some of them had stayed at home, so that they could
      help fight it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that brief glimpse before he rode down into a hollow and so lost sight
      of it, he knew that the fire they had fought and vanquished before had
      been a puny blaze compared with this one. The ground it had burned was not
      broad enough to do more than check this fire temporarily. It would simply
      burn around the blackened area and rush on and on, until the bend of the
      river turned it back to the north, where the river's first tributary
      stream would stop it for good and all. But before that happened it would
      have done its worst&mdash;and its worst was enough to pale the face of
      every prairie dweller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more he caught sight of the fire as he was riding swiftly across the
      level land to the east of Cold Spring Coulee. He was going to see if
      Manley's fire guards were any good, and if anyone was there ready to fight
      it when it came up; they could set a back fire from the guards, he
      thought, even if the guards themselves were not wide enough to hold the
      main fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pounded heavily down the long trail into the coulee, passed close by
      the house with a glance sidelong to see if anybody was in sight there,
      rounded the corral to follow the trail which wound zigzag up the farther
      coulee wall, and overtook Val, running bareheaded up the hill, dragging a
      wet sack after her. She was panting already from the climb, and she had on
      thin slippers with high heels, he noticed, that impeded her progress and
      promised a sprained ankle before she reached the top. Kent laughed grimly
      when he overtook her; he thought it was like a five-year-old child running
      with a cup of water to put out a burning house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you think you're going with that sack?&rdquo; he called out, by way of
      greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned a pale, terrified face toward him, and reached up a hand
      mechanically to push her fair hair out of her eyes. &ldquo;So much smoke was
      rolling into the coulee,&rdquo; she panted, &ldquo;and I knew there must be a fire.
      And I've never felt quite easy about our guards since Polycarp Jenks said&mdash;Do
      you know where it is&mdash;the fire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's between here and the railroad. Give me that sack, and you go on back
      to the house. You can't do any good.&rdquo; And when she handed the sack up to
      him and then kept on up the hill, he became autocratic in his tone. &ldquo;Go on
      back to the house, I tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not do anything of the kind,&rdquo; she retorted indignantly, and Kent
      gave a snort of disapproval, kicked his horse into a lunging gallop, and
      left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll spoil your complexion,&rdquo; he cried over his shoulder, &ldquo;and that's
      about all you will do. You better go back and get a parasol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val did not attempt to reply, but she refused to let his taunts turn her
      back, and kept stubbornly climbing, though tears of pure rage filled her
      eyes and even slipped over the lids to her cheeks. Before she had reached
      the top, he was charging down upon her again, and the pallor of his face
      told her much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All hell couldn't stop that fire!&rdquo; he cried, before he was near her, and
      the words were barely distinguishable in the roar which was growing louder
      and more terrifying. <i>&ldquo;Get back!</i> You want to stand there till it
      comes down on you?&rdquo; Then, just as he was passing, he saw how white and
      trembling she was, and he pulled up, with Michael sliding his front feet
      in the loose soil that he might stop on that steep slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't want to go and faint,&rdquo; he remonstrated in a more kindly tone,
      vaguely conscious that he had perhaps seemed brutal. &ldquo;Here, give me your
      hand, and stick your toe in the stirrup. Ah, don't waste time trying to
      make up your mind&mdash;up you come! Don't you want to save the house and
      corrals&mdash;and the haystacks? We've got our work cut out, let me tell
      you, if we do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had leaned and lifted her up bodily, helped her to put her foot in the
      stirrup from which he had drawn his own, and he held her beside him while
      he sent Michael down the trail as fast as he dared. It was a good deal of
      a nuisance, having to look after her when seconds were so precious, but he
      couldn't go on and leave her, though she might easily have reached the
      bottom as soon as he if she had not been so frightened. He was afraid to
      trust her; she looked, to him, as if she were going to faint in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't want to get scared,&rdquo; he said, as calmly as he could. &ldquo;It's back
      two or three miles on the bench yet, and I guess we can easy stop it from
      burning anything but the grass. It's this wind, you see. Manley went to
      town, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered weakly. &ldquo;He went yesterday, and stayed over. I'm all
      alone, and I didn't know what to do, only to go up and try&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use, up there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were at the corral gate then, and he set her down carefully, then
      dismounted and turned Michael into the corral and shut the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we can't step it, and I ain't close by, I wish you'd let Michael out,&rdquo;
       he said hurriedly, his eyes taking in the immediate surroundings and
      measuring the danger which lurked in weeds, grass, and scattered hay. &ldquo;A
      horse don't have much show when he's shut up, and&mdash;Out there where
      that dry ditch runs, we'll back-fire. You take this sack and come and
      watch out my fire don't jump the ditch. We'll carry it around the house,
      just the other side the trail.&rdquo; He was pulling a handful of grass for a
      torch, and while he was twisting it and feeling in his pocket for a match,
      he looked at her keenly. &ldquo;You aren't going to get hysterics and leave me
      to fight it alone, are you?&rdquo; he challenged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I'm not quite such a silly,&rdquo; she answered stiffly, and he smiled
      to himself as he ran along the far side of the ditch with his blazing tuft
      of grass, setting fire to the tangled, brown mat which covered the coulee
      bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val followed slowly behind him, watching that the blaze did not blow back
      across the ditch, and beating it out when it seemed likely to do so. Now
      that she could actually do something, she was no more excited than he, if
      one could judge by her manner. She did look sulky, however, at his way of
      treating her.
    </p>
    <p>
      To back-fire on short notice, with no fresh-turned furrow of moist earth,
      but only a shallow little dry ditch with the grass almost meeting over its
      top in places, is ticklish business at best. Kent went slowly, stamping
      out incipient blazes that seemed likely to turn unruly, and not trusting
      Val any more than he was compelled to do. She was a woman, and Kent's
      experience with women of her particular type had not been extensive enough
      to breed confidence in an emergency like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no more than finished stringing his line of fire in the irregular
      half circle which enclosed house, corral, stables, and haystacks, and had
      for its eastern half the muddy depression which, in seasons less dry, was
      a fair-sized creek fed by the spring, when a jagged line of fire with an
      upper wall of tumbling, brown smoke, leaped into view at the top of the
      bluff.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing was in his favor: The grass upon the hillside was scantier than
      on the level upland, and here and there were patches of yellow soil
      absolutely bare of vegetation, where a fire would be compelled to halt and
      creep slowly around. Also, fire usually burns slower down a hill than over
      a level. On the other hand, the long, seamlike depressions which ran to
      the top were filled with dry brush, and even the coulee bottom had clumps
      of rosebushes and wild currant, where the flames would revel briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But already the black, smoking line which curved around the haystacks to
      the north, and around the house toward the south, was widening with every
      passing second.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val had a tub half filled with water at the house, and that helped
      amazingly by making it possible to keep the sacks wet, so that every blow
      counted as they beat out the ragged tongues of flame which, in that wind,
      would jump here and there the ditch and the road, and go creeping back
      toward the stacks and the buildings. For it was a long line they were
      guarding, and there was a good deal of running up and down in their
      endeavor to be in two places at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Val, in turning to strike a new-born flame behind her, swept her
      skirt across a tuft of smoldering grass and set herself afire. With the
      excitement of watching all points at once, and with the smoke and smell of
      fire all about her, she did not see what had happened, and must have paid
      a frightful penalty if Kent had not, at that moment, been running past her
      to reach a point where a blaze had jumped the ditch.
    </p>
    <p>
      He swerved, and swung a newly wet sack around her with a force which would
      have knocked her down if he had not at the same time caught and held her.
      Val screamed, and struggled in his arms, and Kent knew that it was of him
      she was afraid. As soon as he dared, he released her and backed away
      sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry I didn't have time to say please&mdash;you were just ready to go up
      in smoke,&rdquo; he flung savagely over his shoulder. But he found himself
      shaking and weak, so that when he reached the blaze he must beat out, the
      sack was heavy as lead. &ldquo;Afraid of <i>me</i>&mdash;women sure do beat
      hell!&rdquo; he told himself, when he was a bit steadier. He glanced back at her
      resentfully. Val was stooping, inspecting the damage done to her dress.
      She stood up, looked at him, and he saw that her face was white again, as
      it had been upon the hillside.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later he was near her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Burnett, I'm&mdash;ashamed&mdash;but I didn't know, and you&mdash;you
      startled me,&rdquo; she stopped him long enough to confess, though she did not
      meet his eyes. &ldquo;You saved&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be startled worse, if you let the fire hang there in that bunch of
      grass,&rdquo; he interrupted coolly. &ldquo;Behind you, there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned obediently, and swung her sack down several times upon a
      smoldering spot, and the incident was closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speedily it was forgotten, also. For with the meeting of the fires, which
      they stood still to watch, a patch of wild rosebushes was caught fairly
      upon both sides, and flared high, with a great snapping and crackling. The
      wind seized upon the blaze, flung it toward them like a great, yellow
      banner, and swept cinders and burning twigs far out over the blackened
      path of the back fire. Kent watched it and hardly breathed, but Val was
      shielding her face from the searing heat with her arms, and so did not see
      what happened then. A burning branch like a long, flaming dagger flew
      straight with the wind and lighted true as if flung by the hand of an
      enemy. A long, neatly tapered stack received it fairly, and Kent's cry
      brought Val's arms down, and her scared eyes staring at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That settles the hay,&rdquo; he exclaimed, and raced for the stacks knowing all
      the while that he could do nothing, and yet panting in his hurry to reach
      the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael, trampling uneasily in the corral, lifted his head and neighed
      shrilly as Kent passed him on the run. Michael had watched fearfully the
      fire sweeping down upon him, and his fear had troubled Val not a little.
      When she saw Kent pass the gate, she hurried up and threw it open,
      wondering a little that Kent should forget his horse. He had told her to
      see that he was turned loose if the fire could not be stopped&mdash;and
      now he seemed to have forgotten it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael, with a snort and an upward toss of his head to throw the dragging
      reins away from his feet, left the corral with one jump, and clattered
      away, past the house and up the hill, on the trail which led toward home.
      Val stood for a moment watching him. Could he out-run the fire? He was
      holding his head turned to one side now, so that the reins dangled away
      from his pounding feet; once he stumbled to his knees, but he was up in a
      flash, and running faster than ever. He passed out of sight over the hill,
      and Val, with eyes smarting and cheeks burning from the heat, drew a long
      breath and started after Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent was backing, step by step, away from the heat of the burning stacks.
      The roar, and the crackle, and the heat were terrific; it was as if the
      whole world was burning around them, and they only were left. A brand flew
      low over Val's head as she ran staggeringly, with a bewildered sense that
      she must hurry somewhere and do something immediately, to save something
      which positively must be saved. A spark from the brand fell upon her hand,
      and she looked up stupidly. The heat and the smoke were choking her so
      that she could scarcely breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new crackle was added to the uproar of flames. Kent, still backing from
      the furnace of blazing hay, turned, and saw that the stable, with its roof
      of musty hay, was afire. And, just beyond, Val, her face covered with her
      sooty hands, was staggering drunkenly. He reached her as she fell to her
      knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;can't&mdash;fight&mdash;any more,&rdquo; she whispered faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked her up in his arms and hesitated, his face toward the house;
      then ran straight away from it, stumbled across the dry ditch and out
      across the blackened strip which their own back fire had swept clean of
      grass. The hot earth burned his feet through the soles of his riding
      boots, but the wind carried the heat and the smoke away, behind them.
      Clumps of bushes were still burning at the roots, but he avoided them and
      kept on to the far side hill, where a barren, yellow patch, with jutting
      sandstone rocks, offered a resting place. He set Val down upon a rock,
      placed himself beside her so that she was leaning against him, and began
      fanning her vigorously with his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank the Lord, we're behind that smoke, anyhow,&rdquo; he observed, when he
      could get his breath. He felt that silence was not good for the woman
      beside him, though he doubted much whether she was in a condition to
      understand him. She was gasping irregularly, and her body was a dead
      weight against him. &ldquo;It was sure fierce, there, for a few minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked out across the coulee at the burning stables, and waited for the
      house to catch. He could not hope that it would escape, but he did not
      mention the probability of its burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your eyes shut,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That'll help some, and soon as we can
      we'll go to the spring and give our faces and hands a good bath.&rdquo; He
      untied his silk neckerchief, shook out the cinders, and pressed it against
      her closed eyes. &ldquo;Keep that over 'em,&rdquo; he commanded, &ldquo;till we can do
      better. My eyes are more used to smoke than yours, I guess. Working around
      branding fires toughens 'em some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still she did not attempt to speak, and she did not seem to have energy
      enough left to keep the silk over her eyes. The wind blew it off without
      her stirring a finger to prevent, and Kent caught it just in time to save
      it from sailing away toward the fire. After that he held it in place
      himself, and he did not try to keep talking. He sat quietly, with his arm
      around her, as impersonal in the embrace as if he were holding a strange
      partner in a dance, and watched the stacks burn, and the stables. He saw
      the corral take fire, rail by rail, until it was all ablaze. He saw hens
      and roosters running heavily, with wings dragging, until the heat toppled
      them over. He saw a cat, with white spots upon its sides, leave the bushes
      down by the creek and go bounding in terror to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      And still the house stood there, the curtains flapping in and out through
      the open windows, the kitchen door banging open and shut as the gusts of
      wind caught it. The fire licked as close as burned ground and rocky creek
      bed would let it, and the flames which had stayed behind to eat the spare
      gleanings died, while the main line raged on up the hillside and
      disappeared in a huge, curling wave of smoke. The stacks burned down to
      blackened, smoldering butts. The willows next the spring, and the
      chokecherries and wild currants withered in the heat and waved charred,
      naked arms impotently in the wind. The stable crumpled up, flared, and
      became a heap of embers. The corral was but a ragged line of smoking,
      half-burned sticks and ashes. Spirals of smoke, like dying camp fires,
      blew thin ribbons out over the desolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent drew a long breath and glanced down at the limp figure in his arms.
      She lay so very still that in spite of a quivering breath now and then he
      had a swift, unreasoning fear she might be dead. Her hair was a tangled
      mass of gold upon her head, and spilled over his arm. He carefully picked
      a flake or two of charred grass from the locks on her temples, and
      discovered how fine and soft was the hair. He lifted the grimy neckerchief
      from her eyes and looked down at her face, smoke-soiled and reddened from
      the heat. Her lips were drooped pitifully, like a hurt child. Her lashes,
      he noticed for the first time, were at least four shades darker than her
      hair. His gaze traveled on down her slim figure to her ringed fingers
      lying loosely in her lap, a long, dry-looking blister upon one hand near
      the thumb; down to her slippers, showing beneath her scorched skirt. And
      he drew another long breath. He did not know why, but he had a strange,
      fleeting sense of possession, and it startled him into action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You gone to sleep?&rdquo; he called gently, and gave her a little shake. &ldquo;We
      can get to the spring now, if you feel like walking that far; if you
      don't, I reckon I'll have to carry you&mdash;for I sure do want a drink!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She half lifted her lashes and let them drop again, as if life were not
      worth the effort of living. Kent hesitated, set his lips tightly together,
      and lifted her up straighter. His eyes were intent and stern, as though
      some great issue was at stake, and he must rouse her at once, in spite of
      everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, this won't do at all,&rdquo; he said&mdash;but he was speaking to himself
      and his quivering nerves, more than to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighed, made a conscious effort, and half opened her eyes again. But
      she seemed not to share his anxiety for action, and her mental and
      physical apathy were not to be mistaken. The girl was utterly exhausted
      with fire-fighting and nervous strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to be all in,&rdquo; he observed, his voice softly complaining. &ldquo;Well,
      I packed you over here, and I reckon I better pack you back again&mdash;if
      you <i>won't</i> try to walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She muttered something, of which Kent only distinguished &ldquo;a minute.&rdquo; But
      she was still limp, and absolutely without interest in anything, and so,
      after a moment of hesitation, he gathered her up in his arms and carried
      her back to the house, kicked the door savagely open, took her in through
      the kitchen, and laid her down upon the couch, with a sigh of relief that
      he was rid of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The couch was gay with a bright, silk spread of &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; patchwork, and
      piled generously with dainty cushions, too evidently made for ornamental
      purposes than for use. But Kent piled the cushions recklessly around her,
      tucked her smudgy skirts close, went and got a towel, which he immersed
      recklessly in the water pail, and bathed her face and hands with clumsy
      gentleness, and pushed back her tangled hair. The burn upon her hand
      showed an angry red around the white of the blister, and he laid the wet
      towel carefully upon it. She did not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a man, and he had lived all his life among men. He could fight
      anything that was fightable. He could save her life, but after this slight
      attention to her comfort he had reached the limitations set by his purely
      masculine training. He lowered the shades so that the room was dusky and
      as cool as any other place in that fire-tortured land, and felt that he
      could no do more for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood for a moment looking down at the inert, grimy little figure
      stretched out straight, like a corpse, upon the bright-hued couch, her
      eyes closed and sunken, with blue shadows beneath, her lips pale and still
      with that tired, pitiful droop. He stooped and rearranged the wet towel on
      her burned hand, held his face close above hers for a second, sighed,
      frowned, and tiptoed out into the kitchen, closing the door carefully
      behind him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. DESOLATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      For more than two hours Kent sat outside in the shade of the house, and
      stared out over the black desolation of the coulee. His horse was gone, so
      that he could not ride anywhere&mdash;and there was nowhere in particular
      to ride. For twenty miles around there was no woman whom he could bring to
      Val's assistance, even if he had been sure that she needed assistance.
      Several times he tiptoed into the kitchen, opened the door into the front
      room an inch or so, and peered in at her. The third time, she had relaxed
      from the corpselike position, and had thrown an arm up over her face, as
      if she were shielding her eyes from something. He took heart at that, and
      went out and foraged for firewood.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a hard-beaten zone around the corral and stables, which had kept
      the fire from spreading toward the house, and the wind had borne the
      sparks and embers back toward the spring, so that the house stood in a
      brown oasis of unburned grass and weeds, scanty enough, it is true, but
      yet a relief from the dead black surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woodpile had not suffered. A chopping block, a decrepit sawhorse, an
      axe, and a rusty bucksaw marked the spot; also three ties, hacked
      eloquently in places, and just five sticks of wood, evidently chopped from
      a tie by a man in haste. Kent looked at that woodpile, and swore. He had
      always known that Manley had an aversion to laboring with his hands, but
      he was unprepared for such an exhibition of shiftlessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He savagely attacked the three ties, chopped them into firewood, and piled
      them neatly, and then, walking upon his toes, he made a fire in the
      kitchen stove, filled the woodbox, the teakettle, and the water pail, sat
      out in the shade until he heard the kettle boiling over on the stove, took
      another peep in at Val, and then, moving as quietly as he could, proceeded
      to cook supper for them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been perfectly familiar with the kitchen arrangements in the days
      when Manley was a bachelor, and it interested him and filled him with a
      respectful admiration for woman in the abstract and for Val in particular,
      to see how changed everything was, and how daintily clean and orderly.
      Val's smooth, white hands, with their two sparkly rings and the broad
      wedding band, did not suggest a familiarity with actual work about a
      house, but the effect of her labor and thought confronted him at every
      turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can see your face in everything you pick up that was made to shine,&rdquo;
       he commented, standing for a moment while he surveyed the bottom of a
      stewpan. &ldquo;She don't look it, but that yellow-eyed little dame sure knows
      how to keep house.&rdquo; Then he heard her cough, and set down the stewpan
      hurriedly and went to see if she wanted anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val was sitting upon the couch, her two hands pushing back her hair,
      gazing stupidly around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything's all ready but the tea,&rdquo; Kent announced, in a perfectly
      matter-of-fact tone. &ldquo;I was just waiting to see how strong you want it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val turned her yellow-brown eyes upon him in bewilderment. &ldquo;Why, Mr.
      Burnett&mdash;maybe I wasn't dreaming, then. I thought there was a fire.
      Was there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent grinned. &ldquo;Kinda. You worked like a son of a gun, too&mdash;till there
      wasn't any more to do, and then you laid 'em down for fair. You were all
      in, so I packed you in and put you there where you could be comfortable.
      And supper's ready&mdash;but how strong do you want your tea? I kinda had
      an idea,&rdquo; he added lamely, &ldquo;that women drink tea, mostly. I made coffee
      for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val let herself drop back among the pretty pillows. &ldquo;I don't want any. If
      there was a fire,&rdquo; she said dully, &ldquo;then it's true. Everything's all
      burned up. I don't want any tea. I want to die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent studied her for a moment. &ldquo;Well, in that case&mdash;shall I get the
      axe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val had closed her eyes, but she opened them again. &ldquo;I don't care what you
      do,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I aim to please,&rdquo; he told her calmly. &ldquo;What <i>I'd</i> do, in your
      place, would be to go and put on something that ain't all smoked and
      scorched like a&mdash;a ham, and then I'd sit up and drink some tea, and
      be nice about it. But, of course, if you want to cash in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val gave a sob. &ldquo;I can't help it&mdash;I'd just as soon be dead as alive.
      It was bad enough before&mdash;and now everything's burned up&mdash;and
      all Manley's nice&mdash;ha-ay&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Kent interrupted mercilessly, &ldquo;I've heard of women doing all kinds
      of fool things&mdash;but this is the first time I ever knew one to commit
      suicide over a couple of measly haystacks!&rdquo; He went out and slammed the
      door so that the house shook, and tramped three times across the kitchen
      floor. &ldquo;That'll make her so mad at me she won't think about anything else
      for a while,&rdquo; he reasoned shrewdly. But all the while his eyes were shiny,
      and when he winked, his lashes became unaccountably moist. He stopped and
      looked out at the blackened coulee. &ldquo;Shut into this hole, week after week,
      without a woman to speak to&mdash;it must be&mdash;damned tough!&rdquo; he
      muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tiptoed up and laid his ear against the inner door, and heard a
      smothered sobbing inside. That did not sound as if she were &ldquo;mad,&rdquo; and he
      promptly cursed himself for a fool and a brute. With his own judgment to
      guide him, he brewed some very creditable tea, sugared and creamed it
      lavishly, browned a slice of bread on top of the stove&mdash;blowing off
      the dust beforehand&mdash;after Arline's recipe for making toast, buttered
      it until it dripped oil, and carried it in to her with the air of a man
      who will have peace even though he must fight for it. The forlorn picture
      she made, lying there with her face buried in a pink-and-blue cushion, and
      with her shoulders shaking with sobs, almost made him retreat, quite
      unnerved. As it was, he merely spilled a third of the tea and just missed
      letting the toast slide from the plate to the floor; when he had righted
      his burden he had recovered his composure to a degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, this won't do at all,&rdquo; he reproved, pulling a chair to the couch by
      the simple method of hooking his toe under a round and dragging it toward
      him. &ldquo;You don't want Man to come and catch you acting like this. He's
      liable to feel pretty blue himself, and he'll need some cheering up&mdash;don't
      you think? I don't know for sure&mdash;but I've always been kinda under
      the impression that's what a man gets a wife for. Ain't it? You don't want
      to throw down your cards now. You sit up and drink this tea, and eat this
      toast, and I'll gamble you'll feel about two hundred per cent better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he urged gently, after a minute. &ldquo;I never thought a nervy little
      woman like you would give up so easy. I was plumb ashamed of myself, the
      way you worked on that back fire. You had me going, for a while. You're
      just tired out, is all ails you. You want to hurry up and drink this,
      before it gets cold. Come on. I'm liable to feel, insulted if you pass up
      my cooking this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val choked back the tears, and, without taking her face from the pillow,
      put out the burned hand gropingly until it touched his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&mdash;you're good,&rdquo; she said brokenly. &ldquo;I used to think you were&mdash;horrid,
      and I'm a&mdash;ashamed. You're good, and I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I ain't going to be good much longer, if you don't get your head
      outa that pillow and drink this tea!&rdquo; His tone was amused and half
      impatient. But his face&mdash;more particularly his eyes&mdash;told
      another story, which perhaps it was as well she did not read. &ldquo;I'll be
      dropping the blamed stuff in another minute. My elbow's plumb getting a
      cramp in it,&rdquo; he added complainingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val made a sound half-way between a sob and a laugh, and sat up. With more
      haste than the occasion warranted, Kent put the tea and toast on the chair
      and started for the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was bound you'd eat before I did,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;and I could stand a
      cup of coffee myself. And, say! If there's anything more you want, just
      holler, and I'll come on the long lope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val took up the teaspoon, tasted the tea, and then regarded the cup
      doubtfully. She never drank sugar in her tea. She wondered how much of it
      he had put in. Her head ached frightfully, and she felt weak and utterly
      hopeless of ever feeling different.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything all right?&rdquo; came Kent's voice from the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Val answered hastily, trying hard to speak with some life and cheer
      in her tone. &ldquo;It's lovely&mdash;all of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want more tea?&rdquo; It sounded, out there, as though he was pushing back his
      chair to rise from the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, this is plenty.&rdquo; Val glanced fearfully toward the kitchen door,
      lifted the teacup, and heroically drank every drop. It was, she
      considered, the least that she could do.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had finished eating he came in, and found her nibbling
      apathetically at the toast. She looked up at him with an apology in her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Burnett, don't think I am always so silly,&rdquo; she began, leaning back
      against the piled pillows with a sigh. &ldquo;I have always thought that I could
      bear anything. But last night I didn't sleep much. I dreamed about fires,
      and that Manley was&mdash;dead&mdash;and I woke up in a perfect horror. It
      was only ten o'clock. So then I sat up and tried to read, and every five
      minutes I would go out and look at the sky, to see if there was a glow
      anywhere. It was foolish, of course. And I didn't sleep at all to-day,
      either. The minute I would lie down I'd imagine I heard a fire roaring.
      And then it came. But I was all used up before that, so I wasn't really&mdash;I
      must have fainted, for I don't remember getting into the house&mdash;and I
      do think fainting is the silliest thing! I never did such a thing before,&rdquo;
       she finished abjectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well&mdash;I guess you had a license to faint if you felt that way,&rdquo;
       he comforted awkwardly. &ldquo;It was the smoke and the heat, I reckon; they
      were enough to put a crimp in anybody. Did Man say about when he would be
      back? Because I ought to be moving along; it's quite a walk to the
      Wishbone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;you won't go till Manley comes! Please! I&mdash;I'd go crazy,
      here alone, and&mdash;and he might not come&mdash;he's frequently
      detained. I&mdash;I've such a horror of fires&mdash;&rdquo; She certainly looked
      as if she had. She was sitting up straight, her hands held out appealingly
      to him, her eyes big and bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure I won't go if you feel that way about it.&rdquo; Kent was half frightened
      at her wild manner. &ldquo;I guess Man will be along pretty soon, anyway. He'll
      hit the trail as soon as he can get behind the fire, that's a cinch. He'll
      be worried to death about you. And you don't need to be afraid of prairie
      fires any more, Mrs. Fleetwood; you're safe. There can't be any more fires
      till next year, anyway; there's nothing left to burn.&rdquo; He turned his face
      to the window and stared out somberly at the ravaged hillside. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;you're
      dead safe, now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm such a fool,&rdquo; Val confessed, her eyes also turning to the window, &ldquo;If
      you want to go, I&mdash;&rdquo; Her mouth was quivering, and she did not finish
      the sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'll stay till Man comes. He's liable to be along any time, now.&rdquo; He
      glanced at her scorched, smoke-stained dress. &ldquo;He'll sure think you made a
      hand, all right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val took the hint, and blushed with true feminine shame that she was not
      looking her best. &ldquo;I'll go and change,&rdquo; she murmured, and rose wearily.
      &ldquo;But I feel as if the world had been 'rolled up in a scroll and burned,'
      as the Bible puts it, and as if nothing matters any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does, though. We'll all go right along living the same as ever, and
      the first snow will make this fire seem as old as the war&mdash;except to
      the cattle; they're the ones to get it in the neck this winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went out and walked aimlessly around in the yard, and went over to the
      smoking remains of the stable, and to the heap of black ashes where the
      stacks had been. Manley would be hard hit, he knew. He wished he would
      hurry and come, and relieve him of the responsibility of keeping Val
      company. He wondered a little, in his masculine way, that women should
      always be afraid when there was no cause for fear. For instance, she had
      stayed alone a good many times, evidently, when there was real danger of a
      fire sweeping down upon her at any hour of the day or night; but now, when
      there was no longer a possibility of anything happening, she had turned
      white and begged him to stay&mdash;and Val, he judged shrewdly, was not
      the sort of woman who finds it easy to beg favors of anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a sound of galloping, up on the hill, and he turned quickly.
      Dull dusk was settling bleakly down upon the land, but he could see three
      or four horsemen just making the first descent from the top. He shouted a
      wordless greeting, and heard their answering yells. In another minute or
      two they were pulling up at the house, where he had hurried to meet them.
      Val, tucking a side comb hastily into her freshly coiled hair, her pretty
      self clothed all in white linen, appeased eagerly in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;where's Manley?&rdquo; she demanded anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blumenthall was dismounting near her, and he touched his hat before he
      answered. &ldquo;We were on the way home, and we thought we'd better ride around
      this way and see how you came out,&rdquo; he evaded. &ldquo;I see you lost your hay
      and buildings&mdash;pretty close call for the house, too, I should judge.
      You must have got here in time to do something, Kent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where's Manley?&rdquo; Val was growing pale again. &ldquo;Has anything happened?
      Is he hurt? Tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he's all right, Mrs. Fleetwood.&rdquo; Blumenthall glanced meaningly at
      Kent&mdash;and Fred De Garmo, sitting to one side of his saddle, looked at
      Polycarp Jenks and smiled slightly. &ldquo;We left town ahead of him, and
      knocked right along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val regarded the group suspiciously. &ldquo;He's coming, then, is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly. Glad you're all right, Mrs. Fleetwood. That was an awful
      fire&mdash;it swept the whole country clean between the two rivers, I'm
      afraid. This wind made it bad.&rdquo; He was tightening his cinch, and now he
      unhooked the stirrup from the horn and mounted again. &ldquo;We'll have to be
      getting along&mdash;don't know, yet, how we came out of it over to the
      ranch. But our guards ought to have stopped it there.&rdquo; He looked at Kent.
      &ldquo;How did the Wishbone make it?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just going to ask you if you knew,&rdquo; Kent replied, scowling because
      he saw Fred looking at Val in what he considered an impertinent manner.
      &ldquo;My horse ran off while I was fighting fire here, so I'm afoot. I was
      waiting for Man to show up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll git all of that you want&mdash;<i>he-he!</i>&rdquo; Polycarp cut in
      tactlessly. &ldquo;Man won't git home t'-night&mdash;not unless&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, come on.&rdquo; Fred started along the charred trail which led across the
      coulee and up the farther side. Blumenthall spoke a last, commonplace
      sentence or two, just to round off the conversation and make the
      termination not too abrupt, and they rode away, with Polycarp glancing
      curiously back, now and then, as though he was tempted to stay and gossip,
      and yet was anxious to know all that had happened at the Double Diamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did Polycarp Jenks mean&mdash;about Manley not coming to-night?&rdquo; Val
      was standing in the doorway, staring after the group of horsemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, I guess, Polycarp never does mean anything half the time; he
      just talks to hear his head roar. Man'll come, all right. This bunch
      happened to beat him out, is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do you think so? Mr. Blumenthall acted as if there was something&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what can you expect of a man that lives on oatmeal mush and toast
      and hot water?&rdquo; Kent demanded aggressively. &ldquo;And Fred De Garmo is always
      grinning and winking at somebody; and that other fellow is a Swede and got
      about as much sense as a prairie dog&mdash;and Polycarp is an old granny
      gossip that nobody ever pays any attention to. Man won't stay in town&mdash;hell
      be too anxious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's terrible,&rdquo; sighed Val, &ldquo;about the hay and the stables. Manley will
      be so discouraged&mdash;he worked so hard to cut and stack that hay. And
      he was just going to gather the calves together and put them in the river
      field, in a couple of weeks&mdash;and now there isn't anything to feed
      them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess he's coming; I hear somebody.&rdquo; Kent was straining his eyes to see
      the top of the hill, where the dismal sight shadows lay heavily upon the
      dismal black earth. &ldquo;Sounds to me like a rig, though. Maybe he drove out.&rdquo;
       He left her, went to the wire gate which gave egress from the tiny,
      unkempt yard, and walked along the trail to meet the newcomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stay there,&rdquo; he called back, when he thought he heard Val following
      him. &ldquo;I'm just going to tell him you're all right. You'll get that white
      dress all smudged up in these ashes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the narrow little gully where the trail crossed the half-dry channel
      from the spring he met the rig. The driver pulled up when he caught sight
      of Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's that? Did she git out of it?&rdquo; cried Arline Hawley, in a breathless
      undertone, &ldquo;Oh&mdash;it's you, is it, Kent? I couldn't stand it&mdash;I
      just had to come and see if she's alive. So I made Hank hitch right up&mdash;as
      soon as we knew the fire wasn't going to git into all that brush along the
      creek, and run down to the town&mdash;and bring me over. And the way&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where's Man?&rdquo; Kent laid a hand upon the wheel and shot the question
      into the stream of Arline's talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man! I dunno what devil gits into men sometimes. Man went and got drunk
      as a fool soon as he seen the fire and knew what coulda happened out here.
      Started right in to drownd his sorrows before he made sure whether he had
      any to drown! If that ain't like a man, every time! Time we all got back
      to town, and the fire was kiting away from us instead of coming up toward
      us, he was too drunk to do anything. He must of poured it down him by the
      quart. He&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manley! Is that you, dear?&rdquo; It was Val, a slim, white figure against the
      blackness all around her, coming down the trail to see what delayed them.
      &ldquo;Why don't you come to the house? There <i>is</i> a house, you know. We
      aren't quite burned out. And I'm all right, so there's no need to worry
      any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, ain't that a darned shame?&rdquo; muttered Arline wrathfully to Kent. &ldquo;A
      feller that'll drink when he's got a wife like that had oughta be hung!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's me, Arline Hawley!&rdquo; She raised her voice to its ordinary shrill
      level. &ldquo;It ain't just the proper time to make a call, I guess, but it's
      better late than never. Man, he was took with one of his spells, so I told
      him I'd come on out and take you back to town. How are you, anyhow? Scared
      plumb to death, I'll bet, when that fire come over the hill. You needn't
      'a' tramped clear down here&mdash;we was coming on to the house in a
      minute. I got to chewin' the rag with Kent. Git in; you might as well ride
      back to the house, now you're here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manley didn't come?&rdquo; Val was standing beside the rig, near Kent. Her
      white-clothed figure was indistinct, and her face obscured in the dark.
      Her voice was quiet&mdash;lifelessly quiet. &ldquo;Is he sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;of course has nerves was all upset&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Then he <i>is</i> sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;nothing dangerous, but&mdash;he wasn't feelin' well, so I
      thought I'd come out and take you back with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man was awful worried; you mustn't think he wasn't. He was pretty near
      crazy, for a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get in and ride. And you mustn't worry none about Man, nor feel hurt that
      he didn't come. He felt so bad&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll walk, thank you; it's only a few steps. And I'm not worried at all.
      I quite understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The team started on slowly, and Mrs. Hawley turned in the seat so that she
      could continue talking without interruption to the two who walked behind.
      But it was Kent who answered her at intervals, when she asked a direct
      question or appeared to be waiting for some comment. Betweenwhiles he was
      wondering if Val did, after all, understand. She knew so little of the
      West and its ways, and her faith in Manley was so firm and unquestioning,
      that he felt sure she was only hurt at what looked very much like an
      indifference to her welfare. He suspected shrewdly that she was thinking
      what she would have done in Manley's place, and was trying to reconcile
      Mrs. Hawley's assurances that Manley was not actually sick or disabled
      with the blunt fact that he had stayed in town and permitted others to
      come out to see if she were alive or dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Kent had another problem to solve. Should he tell her the truth? He
      had never ceased to feel, in some measure, responsible for her position.
      And she was sure to discover the truth before long; not even her innocence
      and her ignorance of life could shield her from that knowledge. He let a
      question or two of Arline's go unanswered while he struggled for a
      decision, but when they reached the house, only one point was dearly
      settled in his mind. Instead of riding as far as he might, and then
      walking across the prairie to the Wishbone, he intended to go on to town
      with them&mdash;&ldquo;to see her through with it.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. VAL'S AWAKENING
    </h2>
    <p>
      Val stood just inside the door of the hotel parlor and glanced swiftly
      around at the place of unpleasant memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I must see Manley before I can tell you whether we shall want to stay
      or not,&rdquo; she replied to Arline's insistence that she &ldquo;go right up to a
      room&rdquo; and lie down. &ldquo;I feel quite well, and you must not bother about me
      at all. If Mr. Burnett will be good enough to send Manley to me&mdash;I
      must see him first of all.&rdquo; It was Val in her most unapproachable mood,
      and Arline subsided before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I'll go and send word to Man, and see about some supper for
      us. I feel as if <i>I</i> could eat ten-penny nails!&rdquo; She went out into
      the hall, hesitated a moment, and then boldly invaded the &ldquo;office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say! have you got Man rounded up yit?&rdquo; she demanded of her husband. &ldquo;And
      how is he, anyhow? That girl ain't got the first idea of what ails him&mdash;how
      anybody with the brains and education she's got can be so thick-headed
      gits me. Jim told me Man's been packing a bottle or two home with him
      every trip he's made for the last month&mdash;and she don't know a thing
      about it. I'd like to know what 'n time they learn folks back East,
      anyhow; to put their eyes and their sense in their pockets, I guess, and
      go along blind as bats. Where's Kent at? Did he go after him? She won't do
      nothing till she sees Man&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Kent came in, and his disgust needed no words. He answered
      Mrs. Hawley's inquiring look with a shake of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't do anything with him,&rdquo; he said morosely. &ldquo;He's so full he don't
      know he's got a wife, hardly. You better go and tell her, Mrs. Hawley.
      Somebody's got to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my heavens!&rdquo; Arline clutched at the doorknob for moral support. &ldquo;I
      could no more face them yellow eyes of hern when they blaze up&mdash;you
      go tell her yourself, if you want her told. I've got to see about some
      supper for us. I ain't had a bite since dinner, and Min's off gadding
      somewheres&mdash;&rdquo; She hurried away, mentally washing her hands of the
      affair. &ldquo;Women's got to learn some time what men is,&rdquo; she soliloquized,
      &ldquo;and I guess she ain't no better than any of the rest of us, that she
      can't learn to take her medicine&mdash;but <i>I</i> ain't goin' to be the
      one to tell her what kinda fellow she's tied to. My stunt'll be helpin'
      her pick up the pieces and make the best of it after she's told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped, just inside the dining room, and listened until she heard
      Kent cross the hall from the office and open the parlor door. &ldquo;Gee! It's
      like a hangin',&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;If she wasn't so plumb innocent&mdash;&rdquo; She
      started for the door which opened into the parlor from the dining room,
      strongly tempted to eavesdrop. She did yield so far as to put her ear to
      the keyhole, but the silence within impressed her strangely, and she
      retreated to the kitchen and closed the door tightly behind her as the
      most practical method of bidding Satan begone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence in the parlor lasted while Kent, standing with his back
      against the door, faced Val and meditated swiftly upon the manner of his
      telling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she demanded at last. &ldquo;I am still waiting to see Manley. I am not
      quite a child, Mr. Burnett. I know something is the matter, and you&mdash;if
      you have any pity, or any feeling of friendship, you will tell me the
      truth. Don't you suppose I know that Arline was&mdash;<i>lying</i> to me
      all the time about Manley? You helped her to lie. So did that other man. I
      waited until I reached town, where I could do something, and now you must
      tell me the truth. Manley is badly hurt, or he is dead. Tell me which it
      is, and take me to him.&rdquo; She spoke fast, as if she was afraid she might
      not be able to finish, though her voice was even and low, it was also flat
      and toneless with her effort to seem perfectly calm and self-controlled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent looked at her, forgot all about leading up to the truth by easy
      stages, as he had intended to do, and gave it to her straight. &ldquo;He ain't
      either one,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He's drunk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val stared at him. &ldquo;Drunk!&rdquo; He could see how even her lips shrank from the
      word. She threw up her head. &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she declared icily, &ldquo;I know to be
      impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do you? Let me tell you that's <i>never</i> impossible with a man,
      not when there's whisky handy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manley is not that sort of a man. When he left me, three years ago, he
      promised me never to frequent places where liquor is sold. He never had
      touched liquor; he never was tempted to touch it. But, just to be doubly
      sure, he promised me, on his honor. He has never broken that promise; I
      know, because he told me so.&rdquo; She made the explanation scornfully, as if
      her pride and her belief in Manley almost forbade the indignity of
      explaining. &ldquo;I don't know why you should come here and insult me,&rdquo; she
      added, with a lofty charity for his sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how it can insult you,&rdquo; he contended. &ldquo;You're got a different
      way of looking at things, but that won't help you to dodge facts. Man's
      drunk. I said it, and I mean it. It ain't the first time, nor the second.
      He was drunk the day you came, and couldn't meet the train. That's why I
      met you. I ought to've told you, I guess, but I hated to make you feel
      bad. So I went to work and sobered him up, and sent him over to get
      married. I've always been kinda sorry for that. It was a low-down trick to
      play on you, and that's a fact. You ought to've had a chance to draw outa
      the game, but I didn't think about it at the time. Man and I have always
      been pretty good friends, and I was thinking of <i>his</i> side of the
      case. I thought he'd straighten up after he got married; he wasn't such a
      hard drinker&mdash;only he'd go on a toot when he got into town, like lots
      of men. I didn't think it had such a strong hold on him. And I knew he
      thought a lot of you, and if you went back on him it'd hit him pretty
      hard. Man ain't a bad fellow, only for that. And he's liable to do better
      when he finds out you know about it. A man will do 'most anything for a
      woman he thinks a lot of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; Val was sitting now upon the red plush chair. Her face was
      perfectly colorless, her manner frozen. The word seemed to speak itself,
      without having any relation whatever to her thoughts and her emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent waited. It seemed to him that she took it harder than she would have
      taken the news that Manley was dead. He had no means of gauging the horror
      of a young woman who has all her life been familiar with such terms as
      &ldquo;the demon rum,&rdquo; and who has been taught that &ldquo;intemperance is the doorway
      to perdition&rdquo;; a young woman whose life has been sheltered jealously from
      all contact with the ugly things of the world, and who believes that she
      might better die than marry a drunkard. He watched her unobtrusively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway, it was worrying over you that made him get off wrong to-day,&rdquo; he
      ventured at last, as a sort of palliative. &ldquo;They say he was going to start
      home right in the face of the fire, and when they wouldn't let him, he
      headed straight for a saloon and commenced to pour whisky down him. He
      thought sure you&mdash;he thought the fire would&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Val interrupted stonily. &ldquo;For the very doubtful honor of shaking
      the hand of a politician, he left me alone to face as best I might the
      possibility of burning alive; and when it seemed likely that the
      possibility had become a certainty, he must celebrate his bereavement by
      becoming a beast. Is that what you would have me believe of my husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's about the size of it,&rdquo; Kent admitted reluctantly. &ldquo;Only I wouldn't
      have put it just that way, maybe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! And how would you pit it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent leaned harder against the door, and looked at her curiously. Women,
      it seemed to him, were always going to extremes; they were either too soft
      and meek, or else they were too hard and unmerciful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would you put it? I am rather curious to know your point of view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I know men better than you do, Mrs. Fleetwood. I know they can do
      some things that look pretty rotten on the surface, and yet be fairly
      decent underneath. You don't know how a habit like that gets a fellow just
      where he's weakest. Man ain't a beast. He's selfish and careless, and he
      gives way too easy, but he thinks the world of you. Jim says he cried like
      a baby when he came into the saloon, and acted like a crazy man. You don't
      want to be too hard on him. I've an idea this will learn him a lesson. If
      you take him the right way, Mrs. Fleetwood, the chances are he'll quit
      drinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val smiled. Kent thought he had never before seen a smile like that, and
      hoped he never would see another. There was in it neither mercy nor mirth,
      but only the hard judgment of a woman who does not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you bring him to me here, Mr. Burnett? I do not feel quite equal to
      invading a saloon and begging him, on my knees, to come&mdash;after the
      conventional manner of drunkards' wives. But I should like to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent stared. &ldquo;He ain't in any shape to argue with,&rdquo; he remonstrated. &ldquo;You
      better wait a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rested her chin upon her hands, folded upon the high chair back, and
      gazed at him with her tawny eyes, that somehow reminded Kent of a lioness
      in a cage. He thought swiftly that a lioness would have as much mercy as
      she had in that mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Burnett,&rdquo; she began quietly, when Kent's nerves were beginning to
      feel the strain of her silent stare, &ldquo;I want to see Manley <i>as he is now</i>.
      I will tell you why. You aren't a woman, and you never will understand,
      but I shall tell you; I want to tell <i>somebody</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was raised well&mdash;that sounds queer, but modesty forbids more. At
      any rate, my mother was very careful about me. She believed in a girl
      marrying and becoming a good wife to a good man, and to that end she
      taught me and trained me. A woman must give her all&mdash;her life, her
      past, present, and future&mdash;to the man she marries. For three years I
      thought how unworthy I was to be Manley's wife. <i>Unworthy</i>, do you
      hear? I slept with his letters under my pillow.&rdquo; The self-contempt in her
      tone! &ldquo;I studied the things I thought would make me a better companion out
      here in the wilderness. I practiced hours and hours every day upon my
      violin, because Manley had admired my playing, and I thought it would
      please him to have me play in the firelight on winter evenings, when the
      blizzards were howling about the house! I learned to cook, to wash
      clothes, to iron, to sweep, and to scrub, and to make my own clothes,
      because Manley's wife would live where she could not hire servants to do
      these things. I lived a beautiful, picturesque dream of domestic
      happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left my friends, my home, all the things I had been accustomed to all
      my life, and I came out here to live that dream!&rdquo; She laughed bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can easily guess how much of it has come true, Mr. Burnett. But you
      don't know what it costs a girl to come down from the clouds and find that
      reality is hard and ugly&mdash;from dreaming of a cozy little nest of a
      home, and the love and care of&mdash;of Manley, to the reality&mdash;to
      carrying water and chopping wood and being left alone, day after day, and
      to find that his love only meant&mdash;Oh, you don't know how a woman
      clings to her ideals! You don't know how I have dung to mine. They have
      become rather tattered, and I have had to mend them often, but I have
      clung to them, even though they do not resemble much the dreams I brought
      with me to this horrible country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if it's true, what you tell me&mdash;if Manley himself is another
      disillusionment&mdash;if beyond his selfishness and his carelessness he is
      a drunken brute whom I can't even respect, then I'm done with my ideals. I
      want to see him just as he is. I want to see him once without the halo I
      have kept shining all these months. I've got my life to live&mdash;but I
      want to face facts and live facts. I can't go on dreaming and making
      believe, after this.&rdquo; She stopped and looked at him speculatively,
      absolutely without emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just before I left home,&rdquo; she went on in the same calm quiet, &ldquo;a girl
      showed me some verses written by a very wicked man. At least, they say he
      is very wicked&mdash;at any rate, he is in jail. I thought the verses
      horrible and brutal; but now I think the man must be very wise. I remember
      a few lines, and they seem to me to mean Manley.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
         &ldquo;For each man kills the thing he loves&mdash;
         Some do it with a bitter look,
         Some with a flattering word;
         The coward does it with a kiss,
         The brave man with a sword.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't remember all of it, but there was another line or two:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
         &ldquo;The kindest use a knife, because
         The dead so soon grow cold.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had that poem now&mdash;I think I could understand it. I think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you've got talking hysterics, if there is such a thing,&rdquo; Kent
      interrupted harshly. &ldquo;You don't know half what you're saying. You've had a
      hard day, and you're all tired out, and everything looks outa focus. I
      know&mdash;I've seen men like that sometimes when some trouble hit 'em
      hard and unexpected. What you want is sleep; not poetry about killing
      people. A man, in the shape you are in, takes to whisky. You're taking to
      graveyard poetry&mdash;and, if you ask <i>me</i>, that's worse than
      whisky. You ain't normal. What you want to do is go straight to bed. When
      you wake up in the morning you won't feel so bad. You won't have half as
      many troubles as you've got now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you wouldn't understand it,&rdquo; Val remarked coldly, still staring at
      him with her chin on her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't yourself, to-morrow morning,&rdquo; Kent declared unsympathetically,
      and called Mrs. Hawley from the kitchen. &ldquo;You better put Mrs. Fleetwood to
      bed,&rdquo; he advised gruffly. &ldquo;And if you've got anything that'll make her
      sleep, give her a dose of it. She's so tired she can't see straight.&rdquo; He
      was nearly to the outside door when Val recovered her speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You men are all alike,&rdquo; she said contemptuously. &ldquo;You give orders and you
      consider yourselves above all the laws of morality or decency; in reality
      you are beneath them. We shouldn't expect anything of the lower animals!
      How I <i>despise</i> men!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you're <i>talking</i>,&rdquo; grinned Kent, quite unmoved. &ldquo;Whack us in a
      bunch all you like&mdash;but don't make one poor devil take it all. Men as
      a class are used to it and can stand it.&rdquo; He was laughing as he left the
      room, but his amusement lasted only until the door was closed behind him.
      &ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and drew a deep breath. &ldquo;I'd sure hate to have that
      little woman say all them things about <i>me!</i>&rdquo; and glanced
      involuntarily over his shoulder to where a crack of light showed under the
      faded green shade of one of the parlor windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the street and entered the saloon where Manley was still
      drinking heavily, his face crimson and blear-eyed and brutalized, his
      speech thickened disgustingly. He was sprawled in an armchair, waving an
      empty glass in an erratic attempt to mark the time of a college ditty six
      or seven years out of date, which he was trying to sing. He leered up at
      Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wife 'sall righ',&rdquo; he informed him solemnly. &ldquo;Knew she would be&mdash;fine
      guards's got out there. 'Sall righ'&mdash;somebody shaid sho. Have a
      drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent glowered down at him, made a swift, mental decision, and pipped him
      by the shoulder. &ldquo;You come with me,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;I've got something
      important I want to tell you. Come on&mdash;if you can walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Course I c'n walk all righ'. Shertainly I can walk. Wha's makes you
      think I can't walk? Want to inshult me? 'Sall my friends here&mdash;no
      secrets from my friends. Wha's want tell me? Shay it here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent was a big man; that is to say, he was tall, well-muscled and active.
      But so was Manley. Kent tried the power of persuasion, leaving force as a
      last, doubtful result. In fifteen minutes or thereabouts he had succeeded
      in getting Manley outside the door, and there he balked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha's matter wish you?&rdquo; he complained, pulling back. &ldquo;C'm on back 'n'
      have drink. Wha's wanna tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wait. I'll tell you all about it in a minute. I've got something to
      show you, and I don't want the bunch to get next. Savvy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had a sickening sense that the subterfuge would not have deceived a
      five-year-old child, but it was accepted without question.
    </p>
    <p>
      He led Manley stumbling up the street, evading a direct statement as to
      his destination, pulled him off the board walk, and took him across a
      vacant lot well sprinkled with old shoes and tin cans. Here Manley fell
      down, and Kent's patience was well tested before he got him up and going
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where y' goin'?&rdquo; Manley inquired pettishly, as often as he could bring
      his tongue to the labor of articulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wait and I'll show you,&rdquo; was Kent's unvaried reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he pushed open a door and led his victim into the darkness of a
      small, windowless building. &ldquo;It's in here&mdash;back against the wall,
      there,&rdquo; he said, pulling Manley after him. By feeling, and by a good sense
      of location, he arrived at a rough bunk built against the farther wall,
      with a blanket or two upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; he announced grimly. &ldquo;You'll have a sweet time getting
      anything to drink here, old boy. When you're sober enough to face your
      wife and have some show of squaring yourself with her, I'll come and let
      you out.&rdquo; He had pushed Manley down upon the bunk, and had reached the
      door before the other could get up and come at him. He pulled the door
      shut with a slam, slipped a padlock into the staple, and snapped it just
      before Manley lurched heavily against it. He was cursing as well as he
      could&mdash;was Manley, and he began kicking like an unruly child shut
      into a closet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, let up,&rdquo; Kent advised him, through a crack in the wall. &ldquo;Want to know
      where you are? Well, you're in Hawley's ice house; you know it's a fine
      place for drunks to sober up in; it's awful popular for that purpose. Aw,
      you can't do any business kicking&mdash;that's been tried lots of times.
      This is sure well built, for an ice house. No, I can't let you out.
      Couldn't possibly, you know. I haven't got the key&mdash;old lady Hawley
      has got it, and she's gone to bed hours ago. You go to sleep and forget
      about it. I'll talk to you in the morning. Good night, and pleasant
      dreams!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last thing Kent heard as he walked away was Manley's profane promise
      to cut Kent's heart out very early the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The darned fool,&rdquo; Kent commented, as he stopped in the first patch of
      lamplight to roll a cigarette. &ldquo;He ain't got another friend in town that'd
      go to the trouble I've gone to for him. He'll realize it, too, when all
      that whisky quits stewing inside him.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XII. A LESSON IN FORGIVENESS
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, old-timer, how you coming? You sure do sleep sound&mdash;this is
      the third time I've come to tell you breakfast is ready and then some.
      You'll get the bottom of the coffeepot, for fair, if you don't hustle.&rdquo;
       Kent left the door of the ice house wide open behind him, so that the
      warmth of mid-morning swept in to do battle with the chill and damp of wet
      sawdust and buried ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manley rolled over so that he faced his visitor, and his reply was abusive
      in the extreme. Kent waited, with an air of impersonal interest, until he
      was done and had turned his face away as though the subject was quite
      exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now you've got that load off your mind, come on over and get a cup
      of coffee. But while you're thinking about whether you want anything but
      my heart's blood, I'm going to speak right up and tell you a few things
      that commonly ain't none of my business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know your wife came within an ace of burning to death yesterday?&rdquo;
       Manley sat up with a jerk and glared at him. &ldquo;Do you know you're burned
      out, slick and clean&mdash;all except the shack? Hay, stables, corral,
      wagons, chickens&mdash;&rdquo; Kent spread his hands in a gesture including all
      minor details. &ldquo;I rode over there when I saw the fire coming, and it's
      lucky I did, old-timer. I back-fired and saved the house&mdash;and your
      wife&mdash;from going up in smoke. But everything else went. Let that sink
      into your system, will you? And just see if you can draw a picture of what
      woulda happened if nobody had showed up&mdash;if that fire had hit the
      coulee with nobody there but your wife. Why, I run onto her half-way up
      the bluff, packing a wet sack, to fight it at the fire guards I Now, Man,
      it ain't any credit to, <i>you</i> that the worst didn't happen. I'd sure
      like to tell you what I think of a fellow that will leave a woman out
      there, twenty miles from town and ten from the nearest neighbor&mdash;and
      them not at home&mdash;to take a chance on a thing like that; but I can't.
      I never learned words enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's another thing. Old lady Hawley took more interest in her than you
      did; she drove out there to see how about it, as soon as the fire had
      burned on past and left the trail safe. And it didn't look good to her&mdash;that
      little woman stuck out there all by herself. She made her pack up some
      clothes, and brought her to town with her. She didn't want to come; she
      had an idea that she ought to stay with it till you showed up. But the
      only original Hawley is sure all right! She talked your wife plumb outa
      the house and into the rig, and brought her to town. She's over to the
      hotel now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Val at the hotel? How long has she been there?&rdquo; Manley began smoothing
      his hair and his crumpled clothes with his hands, &ldquo;Good heavens! You told
      her I'd gone on out, and had missed her on the trail, didn't you, Kent?
      She doesn't know I'm in town, does she? You always were a good fellow&mdash;I
      haven't forgotten how you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can forget it now. I didn't tell her anything like that. I
      didn't think of it, for one thing. She knew all the time that you were in
      town. I'm tired of lying to her. I told her the truth. I told her you were
      drunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manley's jaw dropped. &ldquo;You&mdash;you told her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ex-actly. I told her you were drunk.&rdquo; Kent nodded gravely, and his lips
      curled as he watched the other cringe. &ldquo;She called me a liar,&rdquo; he added,
      with a certain reminiscent amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manley brightened. &ldquo;That's Val&mdash;once she believes in a person she's
      loyal as&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ain't now,&rdquo; Kent interposed dryly. &ldquo;When I let up she was plumb
      convinced. She knows now what ailed you the day she came and you didn't
      meet her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dirty cur! And I thought you were a friend. You&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought right&mdash;until you got to rooting a little too deep in the
      mud, old-timer. And let me tell you something. I was your friend when I
      told her. She's got to know&mdash;you couldn't go on like this much longer
      without having her get wise; she ain't a fool. The thing for you to do now
      is to buck up and let her reform you. I've always heard that women are
      tickled plumb to death when they can reform a man. You go on over there
      and make your little talk, and then buckle down and live up to it. Savvy?
      That's your only chance now. It'll work, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>ought</i> to straighten up, Man, and act white! Not just to square
      yourself with her, but because you're going downhill pretty fast, if you
      only knew it. You ain't anything like you were two years ago, when we
      bached together. You've got to brace up pretty sudden, or you'll be so far
      gone you can't climb back. And when a man has got a wife to look after, it
      seems to me he ought to be the best it's in him to be. You were a fine
      fellow when you first hit the country&mdash;and she thought she was
      getting that same fine fellow when she came away out here to marry you. It
      ain't any of my business&mdash;but do you think you're giving her a square
      deal?&rdquo; He waited a minute, and spoke the next sentence with a certain
      diffidence. &ldquo;I'll gamble you haven't been disappointed in <i>her</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's an angel&mdash;and I'm a beast!&rdquo; groaned Manley, with the
      exaggerated self-abasement which so frequently follows close upon the
      heels of intoxication. &ldquo;She'll never forgive a thing like that&mdash;the
      best thing I can do is to blow my brains out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like Walt. And have your picture enlarged and put in a gold frame, and
      hubby number two learning his morals from your awful example,&rdquo; elaborated
      Kent, in much the same tone he had employed when Val, only the day before,
      had rashly expressed a wish for a speedy death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manley sat up straighter and sent a look of resentment toward the man who
      bantered when he should have sympathized. &ldquo;It's all a big joke with you,
      of course,&rdquo; he flared weakly. &ldquo;You're not married&mdash;to a perfect
      woman; a woman who never did anything wrong in her life, and can't
      understand how anybody should want to, and can't forgive him when he does.
      She expects a man to be a saint. Why, I don't even smoke in the house&mdash;and
      she doesn't dream I'd ever swear, under any circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Kent, a fellow's <i>got</i> to go to town and turn himself loose
      sometimes, when he lives in a rarified atmosphere of refined morality, and
      listens to Songs Without Words and weepy classics on the violin, and never
      a thing to make your feet tingle. She doesn't believe in public dances,
      either. Nor cards. She reads 'The Ring and the Book' evenings, and wants
      to discuss it and read passages of it to me. I used to take some interest
      in those things, and she doesn't seem to see I've changed. Why, hang it,
      Kent, Cold Spring Coulee's no place for Browning&mdash;he doesn't fit in.
      All that sort of thing is a thousand miles behind me&mdash;and I've got to&mdash;&rdquo;
       He stopped short and brooded, his eyes upon the dank sawdust at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a beast,&rdquo; he repeated rather lugubriously. &ldquo;She's an angel&mdash;an
      Eastern-bred angel. And let me tell you, Kent, all that's pretty hard to
      live up to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent looked down at him meditatively, wondering if there was not a good
      deal of truth and justice in Manley's argument. But his sympathies had
      already gone to the other side, and Kent was not the man to make an
      emotional pendulum of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what you going to do about it?&rdquo; he asked, after a short silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer Manley rose to his feet with a certain air of determination,
      which flamed up oddly above his general weakness, like the last sputter of
      a candle burned down. &ldquo;I'm going over and take my medicine&mdash;face the
      music,&rdquo; he said almost sullenly, &ldquo;She's too good for me&mdash;I always
      knew it. And I haven't treated her right&mdash;I've left her out there
      alone too much. But she wouldn't come to town with me&mdash;she said she
      couldn't endure the sight of it. What could I do? <i>I</i> couldn't stay
      out there all the time; there were times when I had to come. She didn't
      seem to mind staying alone. She never objected. She was always sweet sad
      good-natured&mdash;and shut up inside of herself. She just gives you what
      she pleases of her mind, and the rest she hides&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent laughed suddenly. &ldquo;You married men sure do have all kinds of
      trouble,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;A fellow like me can go on a jamboree any time he
      likes, and as long as he likes, and it don't concern anybody but himself&mdash;and
      maybe the man he's working for; and look at you, scared plumb silly
      thinking of what your wife's going to say about it. If you ask me, I'm
      going to trot alone; I'd rather be lonesome than good, any old time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That, however, did not tend to raise Manley's spirits any. He entered the
      hotel with visible reluctance, looked into the parlor, and heaved a sigh
      of relief when he saw that it was empty, wavered at the foot of the steep,
      narrow stairs, and retreated to the dining room, with Kent at his heels
      knowing that the matter had passed quite beyond his help or hindrance and
      had entered that mysterious realm of matrimony where no unwedded man or
      woman may follow and yet is curious enough to linger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just inside the door Manley stopped so suddenly that Kent bumped against
      him. Val, sweet and calm and cool, was sitting just where the smoke-dimmed
      sunlight poured in through a window upon her, and a breeze came with it
      and stirred her hair. She had those purple shadows under her eyes which
      betray us after long, sleepless hours when we live with our troubles and
      the world dreams around us; she had no color at all in her cheeks, and she
      had that aloofness of manner which Manley, in his outburst, had described
      as being shut up inside herself. She glanced up at them, just as she would
      have done had they both been strangers, and went on sugaring her coffee
      with a dainty exactness which, under the circumstances, seemed altogether
      too elaborate to be unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; she greeted them quietly. &ldquo;I think we must be the laziest
      people in town; at any rate, we seem to be the latest risers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent stared at her frankly, so that she flushed a little under the
      scrutiny. Manley consciously avoided looking at her, and muttered
      something unintelligible while he pulled out a chair three places distant
      from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val stole a sidelong, measuring look at her husband while she took a sip
      of coffee, and then her eyes turned upon Kent. More than ever, it seemed
      to him, they resembled the eyes of a lioness watching you quietly from the
      corner of her cage. You could look at them, but you could not look into
      them. Always they met your gaze with a baffling veil of inscrutability.
      But they were darker than the eyes of a lioness; they were human eyes;
      woman eyes&mdash;alluring eyes. She did not say a word, and, after a brief
      stare which might have meant almost anything, she turned to her plate of
      toast and broke away the burned edges of a slice and nibbled at the
      passable center as if she had no trouble beyond a rather unsatisfactory
      breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was foolish, it was childish for three people who knew one another very
      well, to sit and pretend to eat, and to speak no word; so Kent thought,
      and tried to break the silence with some remark which would not sound
      constrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's going to storm,&rdquo; he flung into the silence, like chucking a rock
      into a pond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; Val asked languidly, just grazing him with a glance, in
      that inattentive way she sometimes had. &ldquo;Are you going out home&mdash;or
      to what's left of it&mdash;to-day, Manley?&rdquo; She did not look at him at
      all, Kent observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know&mdash;I'll have to hire a team&mdash;I'll see what&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Hawley thinks we ought to stay here for a few days&mdash;or that I
      ought&mdash;while you make arrangements for building a new stable, and all
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want to stay,&rdquo; Manley agreed rather eagerly, &ldquo;why, of course, you
      can. There's nothing out there to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it doesn't matter in the slightest degree where I stay. I only
      mentioned it because I promised her I would speak to you about it.&rdquo; There
      was more than languor in her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're going to start the fireworks pretty quick,&rdquo; Kent mentally
      diagnosed the situation and rose hurriedly. &ldquo;Well, I've got to hunt a
      horse, myself, and pull out for the Wishbone,&rdquo; he explained gratuitously.
      &ldquo;Ought to've gone last night. Good-bye.&rdquo; He closed the door behind him and
      shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Now they can fight it out,&rdquo; he told himself.
      &ldquo;Glad <i>I</i> ain't a married man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, they did not fight it out then. Kent had no more than reached the
      office when Val rose, hoped that Manley would please excuse her, and left
      the room also. Manley heard her go up-stairs, found out from Arline what
      was the number of Val's room, and followed her. The door was locked, but
      when he rapped upon it Val opened it an inch and held it so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Val, let me in. I want to talk with you. I&mdash;God knows how sorry I am&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If He does, that ought to be sufficient,&rdquo; she answered coldly. &ldquo;I don't
      feel like talking now&mdash;especially upon the subject you would choose.
      You're a man, supposedly. You must know what it is your duty to do. Please
      let us not discuss it&mdash;now or ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Val&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to talk about it, I tell you! I won't&mdash;I <i>can't</i>.
      You must do without the conventional confession and absolution. You must
      have some sort of conscience&mdash;let that receive your penitence.&rdquo; She
      started to close the door, but he caught it with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Val&mdash;do you hate me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him for a moment, as if she were trying to decide. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she
      said at last, &ldquo;I don't think I do; I'm quite sure that I do not. But I'm
      terribly hurt and disappointed.&rdquo; She closed the door then and turned the
      key.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manley stood for a moment rather blankly before it, then put his hands as
      deep in his pockets as they would go, and went slowly down the stairs. At
      that moment he did not feel particularly penitent. She would not listen to
      &ldquo;the conventional confession!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That girl can be hard as nails!&rdquo; he muttered, under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into the office, got a cigar, and lighted it moodily. He glanced
      at the bottles ranged upon the shelves behind the bar, drew in his breath
      for speech, let it go in a sigh, and walked out. He knew perfectly well
      what Val had meant. She had deliberately thrown him back upon his own
      strength. He had fallen by himself, he must pick himself up; and she would
      stand back and watch the struggle, and judge him according to his failure
      or his success. He had a dim sense that it was a dangerous experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked for Kent, found him just as he was mounting at the stables, and
      let him go almost without a word. After all, no one could help him. He
      stood there smoking after Kent had gone, and when his cigar was finished
      he wandered back to the hotel. As was always the case after hard drinking,
      he had a splitting headache. He got a room as close to Val's as he could,
      shut himself into it, and gave himself up to his headache and to gloomy
      meditation. All day he lay upon the bed, and part of the time he slept. At
      supper time he rapped upon Val's door, got no answer, and went down alone,
      to find her in the dining room. There was an empty chair beside her, and
      he took it as his right. She talked a little&mdash;about the fire and the
      damage it had done. She said she was worried because she had forgotten to
      bring the cat, and what would it find to eat out there?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything's burned perfectly black for miles and miles, you know,&rdquo; she
      reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They left the room together, and he followed her upstairs and to her door.
      This time she did not shut him out, and he went in and sat down by the
      window, and looked out upon the meager little street. Never, in the years
      he had known her, had she been so far from him. He watched her covertly
      while she searched for something in her suit case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid I didn't bring enough clothes to last more than a day or two,&rdquo;
       she remarked. &ldquo;I couldn't seem to think of anything that night. Arline did
      most of the packing for me. I'm afraid I misjudged that woman, Manley;
      there's a good deal to her, after all. But she <i>is</i> funny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Val, I want to tell you I'm going to&mdash;to be different. I've been a
      beast, but I'm going to&mdash;&rdquo; So much he had rushed out before she could
      freeze him to silence again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; she cut in, as he hesitated, &ldquo;That is something you must
      judge for yourself, and do by yourself. Do you think you will be able to
      get a team tomorrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;to hell with a team!&rdquo; Manley exploded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val dropped her hairbrush upon the floor. &ldquo;Manley Fleetwood! Has it come
      to that, also? Isn't it enough to&mdash;&rdquo; She choked. &ldquo;Manley, you can be
      a&mdash;a drunken sot, if you choose&mdash;I've no power to prevent you;
      but you shall not swear in my presence. I thought you had some of the
      instincts of a gentleman, but&mdash;&rdquo; She set her teeth hard together. She
      was white around the mouth, and her whole, slim body was aquiver with
      outraged dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something queer in Manley's eyes as he looked at her, the length
      of the tiny room between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon. I remember, now, your Fern Hill ethics. I may <i>go</i>
      to hell, for all of you&mdash;you will simply hold back your immaculate,
      moral skirts so that I may pass without smirching them; but I must not
      mention my destination&mdash;that is so unrefined!&rdquo; He got up from the
      chair, with a laugh that was almost a snort. &ldquo;You refuse to discuss a
      certain subject, though it's almost a matter of life and death with me; at
      least, it was. Your happiness and my own was at stake, I thought. But it's
      all right&mdash;I needn't have worried about it. I still have some of the
      instincts of a gentleman, and your pure ears shall not be offended by any
      profanity or any disagreeable 'conventional confessions.' The absolution,
      let me say, I expected to do without.&rdquo; He started, full of some secret
      intent, for the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val humanized suddenly. By the time his fingers touched the door knob she
      had read his purpose, had readied his side, and was clutching his arm with
      both her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manley Fleetwood, what are you going to do?&rdquo; She was actually panting
      with the jump of her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned the knob, so that the latch clicked. &ldquo;Get drunk. Be the drunken
      sot you expect me to be. Go to that vulgar place which I must not mention
      in your presence. Let go my arm, Val.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was all woman, then. She pulled him away from the door and the unnamed
      horror which lay outside. She was not the crying sort, but she cried, just
      the same&mdash;heartbrokenly, her head against his shoulder, as if she
      herself were the sinner. She clung to him, she begged him to forgive her
      hardness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She learned something which every woman must learn if she would keep a
      little happiness in her life: she learned how to forgive the man she
      loved, and to trust him afterward.

      CHAPTER XIII. ARLINE GIVES A DANCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      A house, it would seem, is almost the least important part of a ranch; one
      can camp, with frying pan and blankets, in the shade of a bush or the
      shelter of canvas. But to do anything upon a ranch, one must have many
      things&mdash;burnable things, for the most part, as Manley was to learn by
      experience when he left Val at the hotel and rode out, the next day, to
      Cold Spring Coulee.
    </p>
    <p>
      To ride over twenty miles of blackness is depressing enough in itself, but
      to find, at the end of the journey, that one's work has all gone for
      nothing, and one's money and one's plans and hopes, is worse than
      depressing. Manley sat upon his horse and gazed rather blankly at the heap
      of black cinders that had been his haystacks, and at the cold embers where
      had stood his stables, and at the warped bits of iron that had been his
      buckboard, his wagon, his rake and mower&mdash;all the things he had
      gathered around him in the three years he had spent upon the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house merely emphasized his loss. He got down, picked up the cat,
      which was mewing plaintively beside his horse, snuggled it into his arm,
      and remounted. Val had told him to be sure and find the cat, and bring it
      back with him. His horses and his cattle&mdash;not many, to be sure, in
      that land of large holdings&mdash;were scattered, and it would take the
      round-up to gather them together again. So the cat, and the horse he rode,
      the bleak coulee, and the unattractive little house with its three rooms
      and its meager porch, were all that he could visualize as his worldly
      possessions. And when he thought of his bank account he winced mentally.
      Before snow fell he would be debt-ridden, the best he could do. For he
      must have a stable, and corral, and hay, and a wagon, and&mdash;he refused
      to remind himself of all the things he must have if he would stay on the
      ranch.
    </p>
    <p>
      His was not a strong nature at best, and now he shrank from facing his
      misfortune and wanted only to get away from the place. He loped his horse
      half-way up the hill, which was not merciful riding. The half-starved cat
      yowled in his arms, and struck her claws through his coat till he felt the
      prick of them, and he swore; at the cat, nominally, but really at the
      trick fate had played upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a week he dallied in town, without heart or courage though Val urged
      him to buy lumber and build, and cheered him as best she could. He did
      make a half-hearted attempt to get lumber to the place, but there seemed
      to be no team in town which he could hire. Every one was busy, and put him
      off. He tried to buy hay of Blumenthall, of the Wishbone, of every man he
      met who had hay. No one had any hay to sell, however. Blumenthall
      complained that he was short, himself, and would buy if he could, rather
      than sell. The Wishbone foreman declared profanely&mdash;that hay was
      going to be worth a dollar a pound to <i>them</i>, before spring. They
      were all sorry for Manley, and told him he was &ldquo;sure playing tough luck,&rdquo;
       but they couldn't sell any hay, that was certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we must manage somehow to fix the place so we can live on it this
      winter,&rdquo; Val would insist, when he told her how every move seemed blocked.
      &ldquo;You're very brave, dear, and I'm proud of the way you are holding out&mdash;but
      Hope is not a good place for you. It would be foolish to stay in town.
      Can't you buy enough hay here in town&mdash;baled hay from the store&mdash;to
      keep our horses through the winter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I tried,&rdquo; Manley responded gloomily. &ldquo;But Brinberg is nearly out.
      He's expecting a carload in, but it hasn't come yet. He said he'd let me
      know when it gets here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the days slipped away, and imperceptibly the heat and haze of
      the fires gave place to bright sunlight and chill winds, and then to the
      chill winds without the sunshine. One morning the ground was frozen hard,
      and all the roofs gleamed white with the heavy frost. Arline bestirred
      herself, and had a heating stove set up in the parlor, and Val went down
      to the dry heat and the peculiar odor of a rusted stove in the flush of
      its first fire since spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, as she sat by her window up-stairs, she looked out at the
      first nip of winter. A few great snowflakes drifted down from the slaty
      sky; a puff of wind sent them dancing down the street, shook more down,
      and whirled them giddily. Then the storm came and swept through the little
      street and whined lonesomely around the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over at the saloon&mdash;&ldquo;Pop's Place,&rdquo; it proclaimed itself in washed-out
      lettering&mdash;three tied horses circled uneasily until they were
      standing back to the storm, their bodies hunched together with the chill
      of it, their tails whipping between their legs. They accentuated the blank
      dreariness of the empty street. The snow was whitening their rumps and
      clinging, in tiny drifts, upon the saddle skirts behind the cantles.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the little hollows of the rough, frozen ground were filling slowly,
      making white patches against the brown of the earth&mdash;patches which
      widened and widened until they met, and the whole street was blanketed
      with fresh, untrodden snow. Val shivered suddenly, and hurried down-stairs
      where the air was warm and all a-steam with cooking, and the odor of
      frying onions smote the nostrils like a blow in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we must stay here, now, till the storm is over,&rdquo; she sighed,
      when she met Manley at dinner. &ldquo;But as soon as it clears we must go back
      to the ranch. I simply cannot endure another week of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're gitting uneasy&mdash;I seen that, two or three days ago,&rdquo; said
      Arline, who had come into the dining room with a tray of meat and
      vegetables, and overheard her. &ldquo;You want to stay, now, till after the
      dance. There's going to be a dance Friday night, you know&mdash;everybody's
      coming. You got to wait for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't attend public dances,&rdquo; Val stated calmly. &ldquo;I am going home as
      soon as the storm clears&mdash;if Manley can buy a little hay, and find
      our horses, and get some sort of a driving vehicle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if he can't, maybe he can round up a <i>ridin''</i> vee-hicle,&rdquo;
       Arline remarked dryly, placing the meat before Manley, the potatoes before
      Val, and the gravy exactly between the two, with mathematical precision.
      &ldquo;I'm givin' that dance myself. You'll have to go&mdash;I'm givin' it in
      your honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In&mdash;my&mdash;why, the <i>idea!</i> It's good of you, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you're goin', and you're goin' to take your vi'lin over and play us
      some pieces. I tucked it into the rig and brought it in, on purpose. I
      planned out the hull thing, driving out to your place. In case you wasn't
      all burned up, I made up my mind I was going to give you a dance, and git
      you acquainted with folks. You needn't to hang back&mdash;I've told
      everybody it was in your honor, and that you played the vi'lin swell, and
      we'd have some real music. And I've sent to Chinook for the dance music&mdash;harp,
      two fiddles, and a coronet&mdash;and you ain't going to stall the hull
      thing now. I didn't mean to tell you till the last minute, but you've got
      to have time to mate up your mind you'll go to a public dance for oncet in
      your life. It ain't going to hurt you none. I've went, ever sence I was
      big enough to reach up and grab holt of my pardner&mdash;and I'm every bit
      as virtuous as you be. You're going, and you'n Man are going to head the
      grand march.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val's face was flushed, her lips pursed, and her eyes wide. Plainly she
      was not quite sure whether she was angry, amused, or insulted. She
      descended straight to a purely feminine objection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I haven't a thing to wear, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you have. While you was dillydallying out in the front room,
      that night, wondering whether you'd have hysterics, or faint, or what all,
      I dug deep in that biggest trunk of yourn, and fished up one of your party
      dresses&mdash;white satin, it is, with embroid'ry all up 'n' down the
      front, and slimpsy lace; it's kinda low-'n'-behold&mdash;one of them&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My white satin&mdash;why, Mrs. Hawley! That&mdash;you must have brought
      the gown I wore to my farewell club reception. It has a train, and&mdash;why,
      the <i>idea!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can cut off the trail&mdash;you got plenty of time&mdash;or you can
      pin it up. I didn't have time that night to see how the thing was made,
      and I took it because I found white skirts and stockin's, and white satin
      slippers to go with it, right handy. You're a bride, and white'll be
      suitable, and the dance is in your honor. Wear it just as it is, fer all
      me. Show the folks what real clothes look like. I never seen a woman
      dressed up that way in my hull life. You wear it, Val, trail 'n' all. I'll
      back you up in it, and tell folks it's my idee, and not yourn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not in the habit of apologizing to people for the clothes I wear.&rdquo;
       Val lifted her chin haughtily. &ldquo;I am not at all sure that I shall go. In
      fact, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you'll go!&rdquo; Arline rested her arms upon her bony hips and snapped her
      meager jaws together. &ldquo;You'll go, if I have to carry you over. I've sent
      for fifteen yards of buntin' to decorate the hall with. I ain't going to
      all that trouble for nothing. I ain't giving a dance in honor of a certain
      person, and then let that person stay away. You&mdash;why, you'd queer
      yourself with the hull country, Val Fleetwood! You ain't got the least
      sign of an excuse You got the clothes, and you ain't sick. There's a
      reason why you got to show up. I ain't going into no details at present,
      but under the circumstances, it's <i>advisable</i>.&rdquo; She smelled something
      burning then, and bolted for the kitchen, where her sharp, rather nasal
      voice was heard upbraiding Minnie for some neglect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polycarp Jenks came in, eyed Val and Manley from under one lifted,
      eyebrow, smiled skinnily, and pulled out a chair with a rasping noise, and
      sat down facing them. Instinctively Val refrained from speaking her mind
      about Arline and her dance before Polycarp, but afterward, in their own
      room, she grew rather eloquent upon the subject. She would not go. She
      would not permit that woman to browbeat her into doing what she did not
      want to do, she said. In her honor, indeed! The impertinence of going to
      the bottom of her trunk, and meddling with her clothes&mdash;with that
      reception gown, of all others! The idea of wearing that gown to a frontier
      dance&mdash;even if she consented to go to such a dance! And expecting her
      to amuse the company by playing &ldquo;pieces&rdquo; on the violin!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why not?&rdquo; Manley was sitting rather apathetically upon the edge of
      the bed, his arms resting upon his knees, his eyes moodily studying the
      intricate rose pattern in the faded Brussels carpet. They were the first
      words he had spoken; one might easily have doubted whether he had heard
      all Val said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Manley Fleetwood, do you mean to tell me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not go, and get acquainted, and quit feeling that you're a pearl cast
      among swine? It strikes me the Hawley person is pretty level-headed on the
      subject. If you're going to live in this country, why not quit thinking
      how out of place you are, and how superior, and meet us all on a level? It
      won't hurt you to go to that dance, and it won't hurt you to play for
      them, if they want you to. You <i>can</i> play, you know; you used to play
      at all the musical doings in Fern Hill, and even in the city sometimes.
      And, let me tell you, Val, we aren't quite savages, out here. I've even
      suspected, sometimes, that we're just as good as Fern Hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We?&rdquo; Val looked at him steadily. &ldquo;So you wish to identify yourself with
      these people&mdash;with Polycarp Jenks, and Arline Hawley, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? They're shaky on grammar, and their manners could stand a little
      polish, but aside from that they're exactly like the people you've lived
      among all your life. Sure, I wish to identify myself with them. I'm just a
      rancher&mdash;pretty small punkins, too, among all these big outfits, and
      you're a rancher's wife. The Hawley person could buy us out for cash
      to-morrow, if she wanted to, and never miss the money. And, Val, she's
      giving that dance in your honor; you ought to appreciate that. The Hawley
      doesn't take a fancy to every woman she sees&mdash;and, let me tell you,
      she stands ace-high in this country. If she didn't like you, she could
      make you wish she did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, upon my word! I begin to suspect you of being a humorist, Manley.
      And even if you mean that seriously&mdash;why, it's all the funnier.&rdquo; To
      prove it, she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manley hesitated, then left the room with a snort, a scowl, and a slam of
      the door; and the sound of Val's laughter followed him down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arline came up, her arms full of white satin, white lace, white cambric,
      and the toes of two white satin slippers showing just above the top of her
      apron pockets. She walked briskly in and deposited her burden upon the
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My! them's the nicest smellin' things I ever had a hold of,&rdquo; she
      observed. &ldquo;And still they don't seem to smell, either. Must be a dandy
      perfumery you've got. I brought up the things, seein' you know they're
      here. I thought you could take your time about cuttin' off the trail and
      fillin' in the neck and sleeves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat down upon the foot of the bed, carefully tucking her gingham apron
      close about her so that it might not come in contact with the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never did see such clothes,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;I dunno how you'll ever git a
      chancet to wear 'em out in this country&mdash;seems to me they're most too
      pretty to wear, anyhow, I can git Marthy Winters to come over and help you&mdash;she
      does sewin'&mdash;and you can use my machine any time you want to. I'd
      take a hold myself if I didn't have all the baking to do for the dance.
      That Min can't learn nothing, seems like. I can't trust her to do a thing,
      hardly, unless I stand right over her. Breed girls ain't much account
      ever; but they're all that'll work out, in this country, seems like.
      Sometimes I swear I'll git a Chink and be done with it&mdash;only I got to
      have somebody I can talk to oncet in a while. I couldn't never talk to a
      Chink&mdash;they don't seem hardly human to me. Do they to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And say! I've got some allover lace&mdash;it's eecrue&mdash;that you can
      fill in the neck with; you're welcome to use it&mdash;there's most a yard
      of it, and I won't never find a use for it. Or I was thinkin', there'll be
      enough cut off'n the trail to make a gamp of the satin, sleeves and all.&rdquo;
       She lifted the shining stuff with manifest awe. &ldquo;It does seem a shame to
      put the shears to it&mdash;but you never'll git any wear out of it the way
      it is, and I don't believe&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mis' <i>Hawley!</i>&rdquo; shrilled the voice of Minnie at the foot of the
      stairs. &ldquo;There's a couple of <i>drummers</i> off'n the <i>train</i>, 'n'
      they want <i>supper</i>, 'n' what'll I <i>give</i> 'em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My heavens! That girl'll drive me crazy, sure!&rdquo; Arline hurried to the
      door. &ldquo;Don't take the roof off'n the house,&rdquo; she cried querulously down
      the stairway. &ldquo;I'm comin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val had not spoken a word. She went over to the bed, lifted a fold of
      satin, and smiled down at it ironically. &ldquo;Mamma and I spent a whole month
      planning and sewing and gloating over you,&rdquo; she said aloud. &ldquo;You were
      almost as important as a wedding gown; the club's farewell reception&mdash;'To
      what base uses we do&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, here's your slippers!&rdquo; Arline thrust half her body into the room and
      held the slippers out to Val. &ldquo;I stuck 'em into my pockets to bring up,
      and forgot all about 'em, mind you, till I was handin' the drummers their
      tea. And one of 'em happened to notice 'em, and raised right up outa his
      chair, an' said: 'Cind'rilla, sure as I live! Say, if there's a foot in
      this town that'll go into them slippers, for God's sake introduce me to
      the owner!' I told him to mind his own business. Drummers do get awful
      fresh when they think they can get away with it.&rdquo; She departed in a hurry,
      as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day after that Arline talked about altering the satin gown. Every
      day Val was noncommittal and unenthusiastic. Occasionally she told Arline
      that she was not going to the dance, but Arline declined to take seriously
      so preposterous a declaration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to break a leg, then,&rdquo; she told Val grimly on Thursday. &ldquo;That's
      the only excuse that'll go down with this bunch. And you better git a move
      on&mdash;it comes off to-morrer night, remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't go, Manley!&rdquo; Val consoled herself by declaring, again and again.
      &ldquo;The idea of Arline Hawley ordering me about like a child! Why should I go
      if I don't care to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Search me.&rdquo; Manley shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;It isn't so long, though,
      since you were just as determined to stay and have the shivaree, you
      remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you and Mr. Burnett tried to do exactly what Arline is doing. You
      seemed to think I was a child, to be ordered about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the very last minute&mdash;to be explicit, an hour before the hall was
      lighted, several hours after smoke first began to rise from the chimney,
      Val suddenly swerved to a reckless mood. Arline had gone to her own room
      to dress, too angry to speak what was in her mind. She had worked since
      five o'clock that morning. She had bullied Val, she had argued, she had
      begged, she had wheedled. Val would not go. Arline had appealed to Manley,
      and Manley had assured her, with a suspicious slurring of his <i>esses</i>
      that he was out of it, and had nothing to say. Val, he said, could not be
      driven.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after Arline had gone to her room and Manley had returned to the
      &ldquo;office&rdquo; that Val suddenly picked up her hairbrush and, with an impish
      light in her eyes, began to pile her hair high upon her head. With her
      lips curved to match the mockery of her eyes, she began hurriedly to
      dress. Later, she went down to the parlor, where four women from the
      neighboring ranches were sitting stiffly and in constrained silence,
      waiting to be escorted to the hall. She swept in upon them, a glorious,
      shimmery creature all in white and gold. The women steed, wavered, and
      looked away&mdash;at the wall, the floor, at anything but Val's bare,
      white shoulders and arms as white. Arline had forgotten to look for
      gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val read the consternation in their weather-tanned faces, and smiled in
      wicked enjoyment. She would shock all of Hope; she would shock even
      Arline, who had insisted upon this. Like a child in mischief, she turned
      and went rustling down the ball to the dining room. She wanted to show
      Arline. She had not thought of the possibility of finding any one but
      Arline and Minnie there, so that she was taken slightly aback when she
      discovered Kent and another man eating a belated supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent looked up, eyed her sharply for just an instant, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, Mrs. Fleetwood,&rdquo; he said calmly. &ldquo;Ready for the ball, I
      see. We got in late.&rdquo; He went on spreading butter upon his bread,
      evidently quite unimpressed by her magnificence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other man stared fixedly at his plate. It was a trifle, but Val
      suddenly felt foolish and ashamed. She took a step or two toward the
      kitchen, then retreated; down the hall she went, up the stairs and into
      her own room, the door of which she shut and locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a fool!&rdquo; she whispered vehemently, and stamped her white-shod foot
      upon the carpet. &ldquo;He looked perfectly disgusted&mdash;and so did that
      other man. And no wonder. Such&mdash;it's <i>vulgar</i>, Val Fleetwood!
      It's just ill-bred, and coarse, and horrid!&rdquo; She threw herself upon the
      bed and put her face in the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one&mdash;she thought it sounded like Manley&mdash;came up and tried
      the door, stood a moment before it, and went away again. Arline's voice,
      sharpened with displeasure, she heard speaking to Minnie upon the stairs.
      They went down, and there was a confusion of voices below. In the street
      beneath her window footsteps sounded intermittently, coming and going with
      a certain eagerness of tread. After a time there came, from a distance,
      the sound of violins and the &ldquo;coronet&rdquo; of which Arline had been so proud;
      and mingled with it was an undercurrent of shuffling feet, a mere whisper
      of sound, cut sharply now and then by the sharp commands of the floor
      manager. They were dancing&mdash;in her honor. And she was a fool; a
      proud, ill-tempered, selfish fool..
    </p>
    <p>
      With one of her quick changes of mood she rose, patted her hair smooth,
      caught up a wrap oddly inharmonious with the gown and slippers, looped her
      train over her arm, tool her violin, and ran lightly down-stairs. The
      parlor, the dining room, the kitchen were deserted and the lights turned
      low. She braced herself mentally, and, flushing at the unaccustomed act,
      rapped timidly upon the door which opened into the office&mdash;which by
      that time she knew was really a saloon. Hawley himself opened the door,
      and in his eyes bulged at sight of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Fleetwood here? I&mdash;I thought, after all, I'd go to the
      dance,&rdquo; she said, in rather a timid voice, shrinking back into the shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fleetwood? Why, I guess he's gone on over. He said you wasn't going. You
      wait a minute. I&mdash;here, Kent! You take Mrs. Fleetwood over to the
      hall. Man's gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! I&mdash;really, it doesn't matter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Kent had already thrown away his cigarette and come out to her,
      closing the door immediately after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take you over&mdash;I was just going, anyway,&rdquo; He assured her, his
      eyes dwelling upon her rather intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;I wanted Manley. I&mdash;I hate to go&mdash;like this, it seems
      so&mdash;so queer, in this place. At first I&mdash;I thought it would be a
      joke, but it isn't; it's silly and,&mdash;and ill-bred. You&mdash;everybody
      will be shocked, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent took a step toward her, where she was shrinking against the stairway.
      Once before she had lost her calm composure and had let him peep into her
      mind. Then it had been on account of Manley; now, womanlike, it was her
      clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn't be anything but all right, if you tried,&rdquo; he told her,
      speaking softly. &ldquo;It isn't silly to look the way the Lord meant you to
      look. You&mdash;you&mdash;oh, you needn't worry&mdash;nobody's going to be
      shocked very hard.&rdquo; He reached out and took the violin from her; took also
      her arm and opened the outer door. &ldquo;You're late,&rdquo; he said, speaking in a
      more commonplace tone. &ldquo;You ought to have overshoes, or something&mdash;those
      white slippers won't be so white time you get there. Maybe I ought to
      carry you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea!&rdquo; she stepped out daintily upon the slushy walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I can take you a block or two around, and have sidewalk all the
      way; that'll help some. Women sure are a lot of bother&mdash;I'm plumb
      sorry for the poor devils that get inveigled into marrying one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mr. Burnett! Do you always talk like that? Because if you do, I
      don't wonder&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Kent interrupted, looking down at her and smiling grimly, &ldquo;as it
      happens, I don't. I'm real nice, generally speaking. Say! this is going to
      be a good deal of trouble, do you know? After you dance with hubby, you've
      got to waltz with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Got</i> to?&rdquo; Val raised her eyebrows, though the expression was lost
      upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure. Look at the way I worked like a horse, saving your life&mdash;and
      the cat's&mdash;and now leading you all over town to keep those nice white
      slippers clean! By rights, you oughtn't to dance with anybody else. But I
      ain't looking for real gratitude. Four or five waltzes is all I'll insist
      on, but&mdash;&rdquo; His tone was lugubrious in the extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll waltz with you once&mdash;for saving the cat; and once for
      saving the slippers. For saving me, I'm not sure that I thank you.&rdquo; Val
      stepped carefully over a muddy spot on the walk. &ldquo;Mr. Burnett, you&mdash;really,
      you're an awfully queer man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent walked to the next crossing and helped her over it before he answered
      her. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he admitted soberly then, &ldquo;I reckon you're right. I am&mdash;queer.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. A WEDDING PRESENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sunday it was, and Val had insisted stubbornly upon going back to the
      ranch; somewhat to her surprise, if one might judge by her face, Arline
      Hawley no longer demurred, but put up lunch enough for a week almost, and
      announced that she was going along. Hank would have to drive out, to bring
      back the team, and she said she needed a rest, after all the work and
      worry of that dance. Manley, upon whose account it was that Val was so
      anxious, seemed to have nothing whatever to say about it. He was sullenly
      acquiescent&mdash;as was perhaps to be expected of a man who had slipped
      into his old habits and despised himself for doing so, and almost hated
      his wife because she had discovered it and said nothing. Val was thankful,
      during that long, bleak ride over the prairie, for Arline's incessant
      chatter. It was better than silence, when the silence means bitter
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Arline, moving excitedly in her seat when they neared Cold
      Spring Coulee, &ldquo;maybe I better tell you that the folks round here has
      kinda planned a little su'prise for you. They don't make much of a showin'
      about bein' neighborly&mdash;not when things go smooth&mdash;but they're
      right there when trouble comes. It's jest a little weddin' present&mdash;and
      if it comes kinda late in the day, why, you don't want to mind that. My
      dance that I gave was a weddin' party, too, if you care to call it that.
      Anyway, it was to raise the money to pay for our present, as far as it
      went&mdash;and I want to tell you right now, Val, that you was sure the
      queen of the ball; everybody said you looked jest like a queen in a
      picture, and I never heard a word ag'inst your low-neck dress. It looked
      all right on <i>you</i>, don't you see? On me, for instance, it woulda
      been something fierce. And I'm real glad you took a hold and danced like
      you did, and never passed nobody up, like some woulda done. You'll be glad
      you did, now you know what it was for. Even danced with Polycarp Jenks&mdash;and
      there ain't hardly any woman but what'll turn <i>him</i> down; I'll bet he
      tromped all over your toes, didn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; Val admitted. &ldquo;What about the surprise you were speaking of,
      Mrs. Hawley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does seem as if you might call me Arline,&rdquo; she complained
      irrelevantly. &ldquo;We're comin' to that&mdash;don't you worry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it&mdash;a piano?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lands, no! You don't need a fiddle and a piano both, do you? Man,
      what'd you rather have for a weddin' present?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manley, upon the front seat beside Hank, gave his shoulders an impatient
      twitch. &ldquo;Fifty thousand dollars,&rdquo; he replied glumly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you're real modest about it,&rdquo; Arline retorted sharply. She was
      beginning to tell herself quite frequently that she &ldquo;didn't have no time
      for Man Fleetwood, seeing he wouldn't brace up and quit drinkin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val's lips curled as she looked at Manley's back. &ldquo;What I should like,&rdquo;
       she said distinctly, &ldquo;is a great, big pile of wood, all cut and ready for
      the stove, and water pails that never would go empty. It's astonishing how
      one's desires eventually narrow down to bare essentials, isn't it? But as
      we near the place, I find those two things more desirable than a piano!&rdquo;
       Then she bit her lip angrily because she had permitted herself to give the
      thrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you poor thing! Man Fleetwood, do you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val impulsively caught her by the arm. &ldquo;Oh, hush! I was only joking,&rdquo; she
      said hastily. &ldquo;I was trying to balance Manley's wish for fifty thousand
      dollars, don't you see? It was stupid of me, I know.&rdquo; She laughed
      unconvincingly. &ldquo;Let me guess what the surprise is. First, is it large or
      small?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kinda big,&rdquo; tittered Arline, falling into the spirit of the joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bigger than a&mdash;wait, now. A sewing machine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arline covered her mouth with her hand and nodded dumbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say all the neighbors gave it and the dance helped pay for it&mdash;let
      me see. Could it possibly be&mdash;what in the world could it be? Manley,
      help me guess! Is it something useful, or just something nice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Useful,&rdquo; said Arline, and snapped her jaws together as if she feared to
      let another word loose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Larger than a sewing machine, and useful.&rdquo; Val puckered her brows over
      the puzzle. &ldquo;And all the neighbors gave it. Do you know, I've been
      thinking all sorts of nasty things about our poor neighbors, because they
      refused to sell Manley any hay. And all the while they were planning this
      sur&mdash;&rdquo; She never finished that sentence, or the word, even.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a jolt over a rock, and a sharp turn to the right, Hank had brought
      them to the very brow of the hill, where they could look down into the
      coulee, and upon the house standing in its tiny, unkempt yard, just beyond
      the sparse growth of bushes which marked the spring creek. Involuntarily
      every head turned that way, and every pair of eyes looked downward. Hank
      chirped to the horses, threw all his weight upon the brake, and they
      rattled down the grade, the brake block squealing against the rear wheels.
      They were half-way down before any one spoke. It was Val, and she almost
      whispered one word:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manley!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arline's eyes were wet, and there was a croak in her voice when she cried
      jubilantly: &ldquo;Well, ain't that better 'n a sewin' machine&mdash;or a
      piano?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Val did not attempt an answer. She was staring&mdash;staring as if she
      could not convince herself of the reality. Even Manley was jarred out of
      his gloomy meditations, and half rose in the seat that he might see over
      Hank's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what your neighbors have done,&rdquo; Arline began eagerly, &ldquo;and they
      nearly busted tryin' to git through in time, and to keep it a dead secret.
      They worked like whiteheads, lemme tell you, and never even stopped for
      the storm. The night of the dance I heard all about how they had to hurry.
      And I guess Kent's there an' got a fire started, like I told him to. I was
      afraid it might be colder'n what it is. I asked him if he wouldn't ride
      over an' warm up the house t'day&mdash;and I see there's a smoke, all
      right.&rdquo; She looked at Manley, and then turned to Val. &ldquo;Well, ain't you
      goin' to say anything? You dumb, both of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val took a deep breath. &ldquo;We should be dumb,&rdquo; she said contritely. &ldquo;We
      should go down on our knees and beg their pardon and yours&mdash;I
      especially. I think I've never in my life felt quite so humbled&mdash;so
      overwhelmed with the goodness of my fellows, and my own unworthiness. I&mdash;I
      can't put it into words&mdash;all the resentment I have felt against the
      country and the people in it&mdash;as if&mdash;oh, tell them all how I
      want them to forgive me for&mdash;for the way I have felt. And&mdash;<i>Arline</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, now&mdash;I didn't bargain for you to make it so serious,&rdquo; Arline
      expostulated, herself near to crying. &ldquo;It ain't nothing much&mdash;us
      folks believe in helpin' when help's needed, that's all. For Heaven's
      sake, don't go 'n' cry about it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hank pulled up at the gate with a loud <i>whoa</i> and a grip of the
      brake. From the kitchen stovepipe a blue ribbon of smoke waved high in the
      clear air. Kent appeared, grinning amiably, in the doorway, but Val was
      looking beyond, and scarcely saw him&mdash;beyond, where stood a new
      stable upon the ashes of the old; a new corral, the posts standing solidly
      in the holes dug for those burned away; a new haystack&mdash;when hay was
      almost priceless! A few chickens wandered about near the stable, and Val
      recognized them as Arline's prized Plymouth Rocks. Small wonder that she
      and Manley were stunned to silence. Manley still looked as if some one had
      dealt him an unexpected blow in the face. Val was white and wide-eyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together they walked out to the stable. When they stopped, she put her
      hand timidly upon his aim. &ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;there is only one way
      to thank them for this, and that is to be the very best it is in us to be.
      We will, won't we? We&mdash;we haven't been our best, but we'll start in
      right now. Shall we, Manley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manley looked down at her for a moment, saying nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we, Manley? Let us start now, and try again. Let's play the fire
      burned up our old selves, and we're all new, and strong&mdash;shall we?
      And we won't feel any resentment for what is past, but we'll work
      together, and think together, and talk together, without any hidden thing
      we can't discuss freely. Please, Manley!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knew what she meant, well enough. For the last two days he had been
      drinking again. On the night of the dance he had barely kept within the
      limit of decent behavior. He had read Val's complete understanding and her
      disgust the morning after&mdash;and since then they had barely spoken
      except when speech was necessary. Oh, he knew what she meant! He stood for
      another minute, and she let go his arm and stood apart, watching his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good deal depended upon the next minute, and they both knew it, and
      hardly breathed. His hand went slowly into a deep pocket of his overcoat,
      his fingers closed over something, and drew it reluctantly to the light.
      Shamefaced, he held it up for her to see&mdash;a flat bottle of generous
      size, full to within a inch of the cork with a pale, yellow liquid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&mdash;take it, and break it into a million pieces,&rdquo; he said
      huskily. &ldquo;I'll try again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her yellow-brown eyes darkened perceptibly. &ldquo;Manley Fleetwood, <i>you</i>
      must throw it away. This is your fight&mdash;be a man and <i>fight</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;there! May God damn me forever if I touch liquor again! I'm
      through with the stuff for keeps!&rdquo; He held the bottle high, without
      looking at it, and sent it crashing against the stable door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manley!&rdquo; She stopped her ears, aghast at his words, but for all that her
      eyes were ashine. She went up to him and put her arms around him. &ldquo;Now we
      can start all over again,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We'll count our lives from this
      minute, dear, and we'll keep them clean and happy. Oh, I'm so glad! So
      glad and so proud, dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent had got half-way down the path from the house; he stopped when Manley
      threw the bottle, and waited. Now he turned abruptly and retraced his
      steps, and he did not look particularly happy, though he had been smiling
      when he left the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arline turned from the window as he entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks like Man has swore off ag'in,&rdquo; she observed dryly. &ldquo;Well, let's
      hope 'n' pray he stays swore off.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XV. A COMPACT
    </h2>
    <p>
      The blackened prairie was fast hiding the mark of its fire torture under a
      cloak of tender new grass, vividly green as a freshly watered, well-kept
      lawn. Meadow larks hopped here and there, searching long for a sheltered
      nesting place, and missing the weeds where they were wont to sway and
      swell their yellow breasts and sing at the sun. They sang just as happily,
      however, on their short, low flights over the levels, or sitting upon
      gray, half-buried boulders upon some barren hilltop. Spring had come with
      lavish warmth. The smoke of burning ranges, the bleak winter with its
      sweeping storms of snow and wind, were pushed info the past, half
      forgotten in this new heaven and new earth, when men were glad simply
      because they were alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a still, Sunday morning&mdash;that day which, when work does not press,
      is set apart in the range land for slight errands, attention to one's
      personal affairs, and to the pursuit of pleasure&mdash;Kent jogged
      placidly down the long hill into Cold Spring Coulee and pulled up at the
      familiar little unpainted house of rough boards, with its incongruously
      dainty curtains at the windows and its tiny yard, green and scrupulously
      clean.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cat with white spots on its sides was washing its face on the kitchen
      doorstep. Val was kneeling beside the front porch, painstakingly stringing
      white grocery twine upon nails, which she drove into the rough posts with
      a small rock. The primitive trellis which resulted was obviously intended
      for the future encouragement of the sweet-pea plants just unfolding their
      second clusters of leaves an inch above ground. She did not see Kent at
      first, and he sat quiet in the saddle, watching her with a flicker of
      amusement in his eyes; but in a moment she struck her finger and sprang up
      with a sharp little cry, throwing the rock from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you know that was going to happen, sooner or later?&rdquo; Kent
      inquired, and so made known his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;how do you do?&rdquo; She came smiling down to the gate, holding the
      hurt finger tightly clasped in the other hand. &ldquo;How comes it you are
      riding this way? Our trail is all growing up to grass, so few ever travel
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're all hard-working folks these days. Where's Man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manley is down to the river, I think.&rdquo; She rested both arms upon the
      gatepost and regarded him with her steady eyes. &ldquo;If you can wait, he will
      be back soon. He only went to see if the river is fordable. He thinks two
      or three of our horses are on the other side, and he'd like to get them.
      The river has been too high, but it's lowering rather fast. Won't you come
      in?&rdquo; She was pleasant, she was unusually friendly, but Kent felt vaguely
      that, somehow, she was different.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not seen her for three months. Just after Christmas he had met her
      and Manley in town, when he was about to leave for a visit to his people
      in Nebraska. He had returned only a week or so before, and, if the truth
      were known, he was not displeased at the errand which brought him this
      way. He dismounted, and when she moved away from the gate he opened it and
      went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he began lightly, when he was seated upon the floor of the porch
      and she was back at her trellis, &ldquo;and how's the world been using you? Had
      any more calamities while I've been gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She busied herself with tying together two pieces of string, so that the
      whole would reach to a certain nail driven higher than her head. She stood
      with both hands uplifted, and her face, and her eyes; she did not reply
      for so long that Kent began to wonder if she had heard him. There was no
      reason why he should watch her so intently, or why he should want to get
      up and push back the one lock of hair which seemed always in rebellion and
      always falling across her temple by itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was drifting into a dreamy wonder that all women with yellow-brown hair
      should not be given yellow-brown eyes also, and to wishing vaguely that it
      might be his luck to meet one some time&mdash;one who was not married&mdash;when
      she looked down at him quite unexpectedly. He was startled, and half
      ashamed, and afraid that she might not like what he, had been thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was staring straight into his eyes, and he knew that she was thinking
      of something that affected her a good deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless it's a calamity to discover that the world is&mdash;what it is,
      and people in it are&mdash;what they are, and that you have been a blind
      idiot. Is that a calamity, Mr. Cowboy? Or is it a blessing? I've been
      wondering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent discovered, when he started to speak, that he had run short of
      breath. &ldquo;I reckon that depends on how the discovery pans out,&rdquo; he
      ventured, after a moment. He was not looking at her then. For some reason,
      unexplained to himself, he felt that it wasn't right for him to look at
      her; nor wise; nor quite pleasant in its effect. He did not know exactly
      what she meant, but he knew very well that she meant something more than
      to make conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said, and gave a little sigh&mdash;&ldquo;that takes so long&mdash;don't
      you know? The panning out, as you call it. It's hard to see things very
      clearly, and to make a decision that you know is going to stand the test,
      and then&mdash;just sit down and fold your hands, because some sordid,
      petty little reason absolutely prevents your doing anything. I hate
      waiting for anything. Don't you? When I want to do a thing, I want to do
      it immediately. These sweet-peas&mdash;now I've fixed the trellis for them
      to climb upon, I resent it because they don't take hold right now. Nasty
      little things&mdash;two inches high, when they should be two yards, and
      all covered with beautiful blossoms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      {Illustration: &ldquo;Little woman, listen here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You're playing hard
      luck, and I know it"}
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the last of April,&rdquo; he qualified. &ldquo;Give 'em a fair chance, can't you?
      They'll make it, all right; things take time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed surrenderingly, and came and sat down upon the porch near him,
      and tapped a slipper toe nervously upon the soft, green sod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time! Yes&mdash;&rdquo; She threw back her head and smiled at him brightly&mdash;and
      appealingly, it seemed to Kent. &ldquo;You remember what you told me once&mdash;about
      sheep-herders and <i>such</i> going crazy out here? The <i>such</i> is
      sometimes ready to agree with you.&rdquo; She turned her head with a quick
      impatience. &ldquo;Such is learning to ride a horse,&rdquo; she informed him airily.
      &ldquo;Such does it on the sly&mdash;and she fell off once and skinned her
      elbow, and she&mdash;well, Such hasn't any sidesaddle&mdash;but she's
      learning, 'by granny!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent laughed unsteadily, and looked sidelong at her with eyes alight. She
      matched the glance for just about one second, and turned her eyes away
      with a certain consciousness that gave Kent a savage delight. Of a truth,
      she was different! She was human, she was intolerably alluring. She was
      not the prim, perfectly well-bred young woman he had met at the train.
      Lonesome Land was doing its work. She was beginning to think as an
      individual&mdash;as a woman; not merely as a member of conventional
      society.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such is beginning to be the proper stuff&mdash;'by granny,&rdquo; he told her
      softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was afraid his tone had offended her. She rose, and her color flared
      and faded. She leaned slightly against the post beside her, and, with a
      hand thrown up and half shielding her face, she stared out across the
      coulee to the hill beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you&mdash;I feel like a fool for talking like this, but one sometimes
      clutches at the least glimmer of sympathy and&mdash;and understanding, and
      speaks what should be kept bottled up inside, I suppose. But I've been
      bottled up for so <i>long</i>&mdash;&rdquo; She struck her free hand suddenly
      against her lips, as if she would apply physical force to keep them from
      losing all self-control. When she spoke again, her voice was calmer. &ldquo;Did
      you ever get to the point, Mr. Cowboy, where you&mdash;you dug right down
      to the bottom of things, and found that you must do something or go mad&mdash;and
      there wasn't a thing you could do? Did you ever?&rdquo; She did not turn toward
      him, but kept her eyes to the hills. When he did not answer, however, she
      swung her head slowly and looked down at him, where he sat almost at her
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent was leaning forward, studying the gashes he had cut in the sod with
      his spurs. His brows were knitted close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I kinda think I'm getting there pretty fast,&rdquo; he owned gravely when he
      felt her gaze upon him. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;because you can understand how one must speak sometimes. Ever
      since I came, you have been&mdash;I don't know&mdash;different. At first I
      didn't like you at all; but I could see you were different. Since then&mdash;well,
      you have now and then said something that made me see one could speak to
      you, and you would understand. So I&mdash;&rdquo; She broke off suddenly and
      laughed an apology. &ldquo;Am I boring you dreadfully? One grows so
      self-centered living alone. If you aren't interested&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; Kent was obliged to clear his throat to get those two words out.
      &ldquo;Go on. Say all you want to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed again wearily. &ldquo;Lately,&rdquo; she confessed nervously, &ldquo;I've taken
      to telling my thoughts to the cat. It's perfectly safe, but, after all, it
      isn't quite satisfying.&rdquo; She stopped again, and stood silent for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's because I am alone, day after day, week in and week out,&rdquo; she went
      on. &ldquo;In a way, I don't mind it&mdash;under the circumstances I prefer to
      be alone, really. I mean, I wouldn't want any of my people near me. But
      one has too much time to think. I tell you this because I feel I ought to
      let you know that you were right that time; I don't suppose you even
      remember it! But I do. Once last fall&mdash;the first time you came to the
      ranch&mdash;you know, the time I met you at the spring, you seemed to see
      that this big, lonesome country was a little too much for me. I resented
      it then. I didn't want any one to tell me what I refused to admit to
      myself. I was trying so hard to like it&mdash;it seemed my only hope, you
      see. But now I'll tell you you were right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes I feel very wicked about it. Sometimes I don't care. And
      sometimes I&mdash;I feel I shall go crazy if I can't talk to some one.
      Nobody comes here, except Polycarp Jenks. The only woman I know really
      well in the country is Arline Hawley. She's good as gold, but&mdash;she's
      intensely practical; you can't tell her your troubles&mdash;not unless
      they're concrete and have to do with your physical well-being. Arline
      lacks imagination.&rdquo; She laughed again shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know why I'm taking it for granted you don't,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You
      think I'm talking pore nonsense, don't you, Mr. Cowboy?&rdquo; She turned full
      toward him, and her yellow-brown eyes challenged him, begged him for
      sympathy and understanding, held him at bay&mdash;but most of all they set
      his blood pounding sullenly in his veins. He got unsteadily to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to pass up a lot of things that count, or you wouldn't say
      that,&rdquo; he reminded her huskily. &ldquo;That night in town, just after the fire,
      for instance. And here, that same afternoon. I tried to jolly you out of
      feeling bad, both those times; but you know I understood. You know damn'
      <i>well</i> I understood! And you know I was sorry. And if you don't know,
      I'd do anything on God's green earth&mdash;&rdquo; He turned sharply away from
      her and stood kicking savagely backward at a clod with his rowel. Then he
      felt her hand touch his arm, and started. After that he stood perfectly
      still, except that he quivered like a frightened horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it doesn't mean much to you&mdash;you have your life, and you're a
      man, and can do things when you want to. But I do so need a friend! Just
      somebody who understands, to whom I can talk when that is the only thing
      will keep me sane. You saved my life once, so I feel&mdash;no, I don't
      mean that. It isn't because of anything you did; it's just that I feel I
      can talk to you more freely than to any one I know. I don't mean whine. I
      hope I'm not a whiner. If I've blundered, I'm willing to&mdash;to take my
      medicine, as you would say. But if I can feel that somewhere in this big,
      empty country just one person will always feel kindly toward me, and wish
      me well, and be sorry for we when I&mdash;when I'm miserable, and&mdash;&rdquo;
       She could not go on. She pressed her lips together tightly, and winked
      back the tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent faced about and laid both his hands upon her shoulders. His face was
      very tender and rather sad, and if she had only understood as well as he
      did&mdash;. But she did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little woman, listen here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You're playing hard luck, and I
      know it; maybe I don't know just how hard&mdash;but maybe I can kinda give
      a guess. If you'll think of me as your friend&mdash;your pal, and if
      you'll always tell yourself that your pal is going to stand by you, no
      matter what comes, why&mdash;all right.&rdquo; He caught his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled up at him, honestly pleased, wholly without guile&mdash;and
      wholly blind. &ldquo;I'd rather have such a friend, just now, than anything I
      know, except&mdash;. But if your sweetheart should object&mdash;could you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His fingers gripped her shoulders tighter for just a second, and he let
      her go. &ldquo;I guess that part'll be all right,&rdquo; he rejoined in a tone she
      could not quite fathom. &ldquo;I never had one in m' life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you poor thing!&rdquo; She stood back and tilted her head at him. &ldquo;You
      poor&mdash;<i>pal</i>. I'll have to see about that immediately. Every
      young man wants a sweetheart&mdash;at least, all the young men I ever knew
      wanted one, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'll gamble they all wanted the same one,&rdquo; he hinted wickedly,
      feeling himself unreasonably happy over something he could not quite put
      into words, even if he had dared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. Hardly ever the same one, luckily. Do you know&mdash;pal, I've
      quite forgotten what it was all about&mdash;the unburdening of my soul, I
      mean. After all, I think I must have been just lonesome. The country is
      just as big, but it isn't quite so&mdash;so <i>empty</i>, you see. Aren't
      you awfully vain, to see how you have peopled it with your friendship?&rdquo;
       She clasped her hands behind her and regarded him speculatively. &ldquo;I hope,
      Mr. Cowboy, you're in earnest about this,&rdquo; she observed doubtfully. &ldquo;I
      hope you have imagination enough to see it isn't silly, because if I
      suspected you weren't playing fair, and would go away and laugh at me, I'd&mdash;scratch&mdash;you.&rdquo;
       She nodded her head slowly at him. &ldquo;I've always been told that, with tiger
      eyes, you find the disposition of a tiger. So if you don't mean it, you'd
      better let me know at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent brought the color into her cheeks with his steady gaze. &ldquo;I was just
      getting scared <i>you</i> didn't mean it,&rdquo; he averred. &ldquo;If my pal goes
      back on me&mdash;why, Lord help her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took a slow, deep breath. &ldquo;How is it you men ratify a solemn
      agreement?&rdquo; she puzzled. &ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo; With a pretty impulse she held out her
      right hand, half grave, half playful. &ldquo;Shake on it, pal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent took her hand and pressed it as hard as he dared. &ldquo;You're going to be
      a dandy little chum,&rdquo; he predicted gamely. &ldquo;But let me tell you right now,
      if you ever get up on your stilts with me, there's going to be all kinds
      of trouble. You call me Kent&mdash;that is,&rdquo; he qualified, with a little,
      unsteady laugh, &ldquo;when there ain't any one around to get shocked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose this <i>isn't</i> quite conventional,&rdquo; she conceded, as if the
      thought had just then occurred to her. &ldquo;But, thank goodness, out here
      there aren't any conventions. Every one lives as every one sees fit. It
      isn't the best thing for some people,&rdquo; she added drearily. &ldquo;Some people
      have to be bolstered up by conventions, or they can't help miring in their
      own weaknesses. But we don't; and as long as we understand&mdash;&rdquo; She
      looked to him for confirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As long as we understand, why, it ain't anybody's business but our own,&rdquo;
       he declared steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed relieved of some lingering doubt. &ldquo;That's exactly it. I don't
      know why I should deny myself a friend, just because that friend happens
      to be a man, and I happen to be&mdash;married. I never did have much
      patience with the rule that a man must either be perfectly indifferent, or
      else make love. I'm so glad you&mdash;understand. So that's all settled,&rdquo;
       she finished briskly, &ldquo;and I find that, as I said, it isn't at all
      necessary for me to unburden my soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stood quiet for a moment, their thoughts too intangible for speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come inside, won't you?&rdquo; she invited at last, coming back to everyday
      matters. &ldquo;Of course you're hungry&mdash;or you ought to be. You daren't
      run away from my cooking this time, Mr. Cowboy. Manley will be back soon,
      I think. I must get some lunch ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent replied that he would stay outside and smoke, so she left him with a
      fleeting smile, infinitely friendly and confiding and glad. He turned and
      looked after her soberly, gave a great sigh, and reached mechanically for
      his tobacco and papers; thoughtfully rolled a cigarette, lighted it, and
      held the match until it burned quite down to his thumb and fingers.
      &ldquo;Pals!&rdquo; he said just under his breath, for the mere sound of the word.
      &ldquo;All right&mdash;pals it is, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smoked slowly, listening to her moving about in the house. Her steps
      came nearer. He turned to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it you wanted to see Manley about?&rdquo; she asked him from the
      doorway. &ldquo;I just happened to wonder what it could be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the Wishbone needs men, and sent me over to tell him he can go to
      work. The wagons are going to start to-morrow. He'll want to gather his
      cattle up, and of course we know about how he's fixed&mdash;for saddle
      horses and the like. He can work for the outfit and draw wages, and get
      his cattle thrown back on this range and his calves branded besides. Get
      paid for doing what he'll have to do anyhow, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Val pushed back the rebellious lock of hair. &ldquo;Of course you
      suggested the idea to the Wishbone. You're always doing something&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The outfit is short-handed,&rdquo; he reiterated. &ldquo;They need him. They ain't
      straining a point to do Man a favor&mdash;don't you ever think it! Well&mdash;he's
      coming,&rdquo; he broke off, and started to the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manley clattered up, vociferously glad to greet him. Kent, at his urgent
      invitation, led his horse to the stable and turned him into the corral,
      unsaddled and unbridled him so that he could eat. Also, he told his
      errand. Manley interrupted the conversation to produce a bottle of whisky
      from a cunningly concealed hole in the depleted haystack, and insisted
      that Kent should take a drink. Kent waved it off, and Manley drew the cork
      and held the bottle to his own lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stood there, with his face uplifted while the yellow liquor gurgled
      down his throat, Kent watched him with a curiously detached interest. So
      that's how Manley had kept his vow! he was thinking, with an impersonal
      contempt. Four good swallows&mdash;Kent counted them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're hitting it pretty strong, Man, for a fellow that swore off last
      fall,&rdquo; he commented aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manley took down the bottle, gave a sigh of pure, animal satisfaction, and
      pushed the cork in with an unconsciously regretful movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fellow's got to get something out of life,&rdquo; he defended peevishly.
      &ldquo;I've had pretty hard luck&mdash;it's enough to drive a fellow to most any
      kind of relief. Burnt out, last fall&mdash;cattle scattered and calves
      running the range all winter&mdash;I haven't got stock enough to stand
      that sort of a deal, Kent. No telling where I stand now on the cattle
      question. I did have close to a hundred head&mdash;and three of my best
      geldings are missing&mdash;a poor man can't stand luck like that. I'm in
      debt too&mdash;and when you've got an iceberg in the house&mdash;when a
      man's own wife don't stand by him&mdash;when he can't get any sympathy
      from the very one that ought to&mdash;but, then, I hope I'm a gentleman; I
      don't make any kick against <i>her</i>&mdash;my domestic affairs are my
      own affairs. Sure. But when your wife freezes up solid&mdash;&rdquo; He held the
      bottle up and looked at it. &ldquo;Best friend I've got,&rdquo; he finished, with a
      whining note in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent turned away disgusted. Manley had coarsened. He had &ldquo;slopped down&rdquo;
       just when he should have braced up and caught the fighting spirit&mdash;the
      spirit that fights and overcomes obstacles. With a tightening of his
      chest, he thought of his &ldquo;pal,&rdquo; tied for life to this whining drunkard. No
      wonder she felt the need of a friend!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, are you going out with the Wishbone?&rdquo; he asked tersely, jerking his
      thoughts back to his errand. &ldquo;If you are, you'll need to go over there
      to-night&mdash;the wagons start out to-morrow. Maybe you better ride
      around by Polly's place and have him come over here, once in a while, to
      look after things. You can't leave your wife alone without somebody to
      kinda keep an eye out for her, you know. Polycarp ain't going to ride this
      spring; he's got rheumatism, or some darned thing. But he can chop what
      wood she'll need, and go to town for her once in a while, and make sure
      she's all right. You better leave your gentlest horse here for her to use,
      too. She can't be left afoot out here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manley was taking another long swallow from the bottle, but he heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sure&mdash;I never thought about that. I guess maybe I <i>had</i>
      better get Polycarp. But Val could make out all right alone. Why, she's
      held it down here for a week at a time&mdash;last winter, when I'd forgot
      to come home&rdquo;&mdash;he winked shamelessly&mdash;&ldquo;or a storm would come up
      so I couldn't get home. Val isn't like some fool women, I'll say that much
      for her. She don't care whether I'm around or not; fact is, sometimes I
      think she's better pleased when I'm gone. But you're right&mdash;I'll see
      Polycarp and have him come over once in a while. Sure. Glad you spoke of
      it. You always had a great head for thinking about other people, Kent. You
      ought to get married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; Kent scowled. &ldquo;I haven't got any grudge against women. The
      world's full of men ready and willing to give 'em a taste of pure,
      unadulterated hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manley stared at him stupidly, and then laughed doubtfully, as if he felt
      certain of having, by his dullness, missed the point of a very good joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that the time was filled with the preparations for Manley's absence.
      Kent did what he could to help, and Val went calmly about the house,
      packing the few necessary personal belongings which might be stuffed into
      a &ldquo;war bag&rdquo; and used during round-up. Beyond an occasional glance of
      friendly understanding, she seemed to have forgotten the compact she had
      made with Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when they were ready to ride away, Kent purposely left his gloves
      lying upon the couch, and remembered them only after Manley was in the
      saddle. So he went back, and Val followed him into the room. He wanted to
      say something&mdash;he did not quite know what&mdash;something that would
      bring them a little closer together, and keep them so; something that
      would make her think of him often and kindly. He picked up his gloves and
      held out his hand to her&mdash;and then a diffidence seized his tongue.
      There was nothing he dared say. All the eloquence, all the tenderness, was
      in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;good-by, pal. Be good to yourself,&rdquo; he said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val smiled up at him tremulously. &ldquo;Good-by, my one friend. Don't&mdash;don't
      get hurt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their clasp tightened, their hands dropped apart rather limply. Kent went
      out and got upon his horse, and rode away beside Manley, and talked of the
      range and of the round-up and of cattle and a dozen other things which
      interest men. But all the while one exultant thought kept reiterating
      itself in his mind: &ldquo;She never said that much to <i>him!</i> She never
      said that much to <i>him!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. MANLEY'S NEW TACTICS
    </h2>
    <p>
      To the east, to the south, to the north went the riders of the Wishbone,
      gathering the cattle which the fires had driven afar. No rivers stopped
      them, nor mountains, nor the deep-scarred coulees, nor the plains. It was
      Manley's first experience in real round-up work, for his own little herd
      he had managed to keep close at home, and what few strayed afar were
      turned back, when opportunity afforded, by his neighbors, who wished him
      well. Now he tasted the pride of ownership to the full, when a VP cow and
      her calf mingled with the milling Wishbones and Double Diamonds. He was
      proud of his brand, and proud of the sentiment which had made him choose
      Val's initials. More than once he explained to his fellows that VP meant
      Val Peyson, and that he had got it recorded just after he and Val were
      engaged. He was not sentimental about her now, but he liked to dwell upon
      the fact that he had been; it showed that he was capable of fine feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      More dominant, however, as the weeks passed and the branding went on,
      became the desire to accumulate property&mdash;cattle. The Wishbone brand
      went scorching through the hair of hundreds of calves, while the VP scared
      tens. It was not right. He felt, somehow, cheated by fate. He mentally
      figured the increase of his herd, and it seemed to him that it took a long
      while, much longer than it should, to gain a respectable number in that
      manner. He cast about in his mind for some rich acquaintance in the East
      who might be prevailed upon to lend him capital enough to buy, say, five
      hundred cows. He began to talk about it occasionally when the boys lay
      around in the evenings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to ride with a long rope,&rdquo; suggested Bob Royden, grinning openly
      at the others. &ldquo;That's the way to work up in the cow business. Capital
      nothing! You don't get enough excitement buying cattle; you want to steal
      'em. That's what I'd do if I had a brand of my own and all your ambitions
      to get rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And get sent up,&rdquo; Manley rounded out the situation. &ldquo;No, thanks.&rdquo; He
      laughed. &ldquo;It's a better way to get to the pen than it is to get rich, from
      all accounts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sandy Moran remembered a fellow who worked a brand and kept it up for
      seven or eight years before they caught him, and he recounted the tale
      between puffs at his cigarette. &ldquo;Only they didn't catch him&rdquo; he finished.
      &ldquo;A puncher put him wise to what was in the wind, and he sold out cheap to
      a tenderfoot and pulled his freight. They never did locate him.&rdquo; Then,
      with a pointed rock which he picked up beside him, he drew a rude diagram
      or two in the dirt. &ldquo;That's how he done it,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Pretty smooth,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the talk went on, as such things will, idly, without purpose save to
      pass the time. Shop talk of the range it was. Tales of stealing, of
      working brands, and of branding unmarked yearlings at weaning time. Of
      this big cattleman and that, who practically stole whole herds, and
      thereby took long strides toward wealth. Range scandals grown old; range
      gossip all of it, of men who had changed a brand or made one, using a
      cinch ring at a tiny fire in a secluded hollow, or a spur, or a jackknife;
      who were caught in the act, after the act, or merely suspected of the
      crime. Of &ldquo;sweat&rdquo; brands, blotched brands, brands added to and altered, of
      trials, of shootings, of hangings, even, and &ldquo;getaways&rdquo; spectacular and
      humorous and pathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manley, being in a measure a pilgrim, and having no experience to draw
      upon, and not much imagination, took no part in the talk, except that he
      listened and was intensely interested. Two months of mingling with men who
      talked little else had its influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      That fall, when Manley had his hay up, and his cattle once more ranging
      close, toward the river and in the broken country bounded upon the west by
      the fenced-in railroad, three calves bore the VP brand&mdash;three husky
      heifers that never had suckled a VP mother. So had the range gossip, sown
      by chance in the soil of his greed of gain and his weakening moral fiber,
      borne fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deed scared him sober for a month. For a month his color changed and
      his blood quickened whenever a horseman showed upon the rim of Cold Spring
      Coulee. For a month he never left the ranch unless business compelled him
      to do so, and his return was speedy, his eyes anxious until he knew that
      all was well. After that his confidence returned. He grew more secretive,
      more self-assured, more at ease with his guilt. He looked the Wishbone men
      squarely in the eye, and it seldom occurred to him that he was a thief; or
      if it did, the word was but a synonym for luck, with shrewdness behind.
      Sometimes he regretted his timidity. Why three calves only? In a deep
      little coulee next the river&mdash;a coulee which the round-up had missed&mdash;had
      been more than three. He might have doubled the number and risked no more
      than for the three. The longer he dwelt upon that the more inclined he was
      to feel that he had cheated himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      That fall there were no fires. It would be long before men grew careless
      when the grass was ripened and the winds blew hot and dry from out the
      west. The big prairie which lay high between the river and Hope was dotted
      with feeding cattle. Wishbones and Double Diamonds, mostly, with here and
      there a stray.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manley grew wily, and began to plan far in advance. He rode here and
      there, quietly keeping his own cattle well down toward the river. There
      was shelter there, and feed, and the idea was a good one. Just before the
      river broke up he saw to it that a few of his own cattle, and with them
      some Wishbone cows and a steer or two, were ranging in a deep, bushy
      coulee, isolated and easily passed by. He had driven them there, and he
      left them there. That spring he worked again with the Wishbone.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the round-up swept the home range, gathering and branding, it chanced
      that his part of the circle took him and Sandy Moran down that way. It was
      hot, and they had thirty or forty head of cattle before them when they
      neared that particular place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No need going down into the breaks here,&rdquo; he told Sandy easily. &ldquo;I've
      been hazing out everything I came across lately. They were mostly my own,
      anyway. I believe I've got it pretty well cleaned up along here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sandy was not the man to hunt hard riding. He went to the rim of the
      coulee and looked down for a minute. He saw nothing moving, and took
      Manley's word for it with no stirring of his easy-going conscience. He
      said all right, and rode on.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. VAL BECOMES AN AUTHOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      Quite as marked had been the change in Val that year. Every time Kent saw
      her, he recognized the fact that she was a little different; a little less
      superior in her attitude, a little more independent in her views of life.
      Her standards seemed slowly changing, and her way of thinking. He did not
      see her often, but when he did the mockery of their friendship struck him
      more keenly, his inward rebellion against circumstances grew more bitter.
      He wondered how she could be so blind as to think they were just pals, and
      no more. She did think so. All the little confidences, all the glances,
      all the smiles, she gave and received frankly, in the name of friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, Kent, this is my ideal of how people should be,&rdquo; she told him
      once, with a perfectly honest enthusiasm. &ldquo;I've always dreamed of such a
      friendship, and I've always believed that some day the right man would
      come along and make it possible. Not one in a thousand could understand
      and meet one half-way&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'd be liable to go farther,&rdquo; Kent assented dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. That's just the trouble. They'd spoil an ideal friendship by falling
      in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darned chumps,&rdquo; Kent classed them sweepingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. Pal, your vocabulary excites my envy. It's so forcible
      sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent grinned reminiscently. &ldquo;It sure is, old girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't mean necessarily profane. I wonder what your vocabulary will
      do to the secret I'm going to tell you.&rdquo; The sweet-peas had reached the
      desired height and profusion of blossoms, thanks to the pails and pails of
      water Val had carried and lavished upon them, and she was gathering a
      handful of the prettiest blooms for him. Her cheeks turned a bit pinker as
      she spoke, and her hesitation raised a wild hope briefly in Kent's heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; He had to force the words out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I hate to tell, but I want you to&mdash;to help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; To Kent, at that moment, she was not Manley's wife; she was not
      any man's wife; she was the girl he loved&mdash;loved with the primitive,
      absorbing passion of the man who lives naturally and does not borrow his
      morals from his next-door neighbor. His code of ethics was his own,
      thought out by himself. Val hated her husband, and her husband did not
      seem to care much for her. They were tied together legally. And a mere
      legality could not hold back the emotions and the desires of Kent Burnett.
      With him, it was not a question of morals: it was a question of Val's
      feeling in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val looked up at him, found something strange in his eyes, and immediately
      looked away again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your eyes are always saying things I can't hear,&rdquo; she observed
      irrelevantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they? Do you want me to act as interpreter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I just want you to listen. Have you noticed anything different about
      me lately, Kent?&rdquo; She tilted her head, while she passed judgment upon a
      cluster of speckled blossoms, odd but not particularly pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, anyway? I'm liable to get off wrong if I tell you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you're so horribly cautious! Have I seemed any more content&mdash;any
      happier lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent picked a spray of flowers and puled them ruthlessly to pieces. &ldquo;Maybe
      I've kinda hoped so,&rdquo; he said, almost in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I've a new interest in life. I just discovered it by accident,
      almost&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent lifted his head and looked keenly at her, and his face was a lighter
      shade of brown than it had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to change everything. Pal, I&mdash;I've been writing things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent discovered he had been holding his breath, and let it go in a long
      sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; After a minute he smiled philosophically. &ldquo;What kinda things?&rdquo; he
      drawled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, verses, but mostly stories. You see,&rdquo; she explained impulsively, &ldquo;I
      want to earn some money&mdash;of my own. I haven't said much, because I
      hate whining; but really, things are growing pretty bad&mdash;between
      Manley and me. I hope it isn't my fault. I have tried every way I know to
      keep my faith in him, and to&mdash;to help him. But he's not the same as
      he was. You know that. And I have a good deal of pride. I can't&mdash;oh,
      it's intolerable having to ask a man for money! Especially when he doesn't
      want to give you any,&rdquo; she added naively. &ldquo;At first it wasn't necessary; I
      had a little of my own, and all my things were new. But one must
      eventually buy things&mdash;for the house, you know, and for one's
      personal needs&mdash;and he seems to resent it dreadfully. I never would
      have believed that Manley could be stingy&mdash;actually stingy; but he
      is, unfortunately. I hate to speak of his faults, even to you. But I've
      got to be honest with you. It isn't nice to say that I'm writing, not for
      any particularly burning desire to express my thoughts, nor for the
      sentiment of it, but to earn money. It's terribly sordid, isn't it?&rdquo; She
      smiled wistfully up at him. &ldquo;But there seems to be money in it, for those
      who succeed, and it's work that I can do here. I have oceans of time, and
      I'm not disturbed!&rdquo; Her lips curved into bitter lines. &ldquo;I do so much
      thinking, I might as well put my brain to some use.&rdquo; With one of her
      sudden changes of mood, she turned to Kent and clasped both hands upon his
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you see, pal, how much our friendship means to me,&rdquo; she said softly.
      &ldquo;I couldn't have told this to another living soul! It seems awfully
      treacherous, saying it even to you&mdash;I mean about him. But you're so
      good&mdash;you always understand, don't you, pal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess so.&rdquo; Kent forced the words out naturally, and kept his breath
      even, and his arms from clasping her. He considered that he performed
      quite a feat of endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're modest!&rdquo; She gave his arm a little shake. &ldquo;Of course you do. You
      know I'm not treacherous, really. You know I'd do anything I could for
      him. But this is something that doesn't concern him at all. He doesn't
      know it, but that is because he would only sneer. When I have really sold
      something, and received the money for it, then it won't matter to me who
      knows. But now it's a solemn secret, just between me and my pal.&rdquo; Her
      yellow-brown eyes dwelt upon his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent, stealing a glance at her from under his drooped lids, wondered if
      she had ever given any time to analyzing herself. He would have given much
      to know if, down deep in her heart, she really believed in this pal
      business; if she was really a friend, and no more. She puzzled him a good
      deal, sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;if anybody can make good at that business, you sure ought to;
      you've got brains enough to write a dictionary.&rdquo; He permitted himself the
      indulgence of saying that much, and he was perfectly sincere. He honestly
      considered Val the cleverest woman in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed with gratification. &ldquo;Your sublime confidence, while it is
      undoubtedly mistaken, is nevertheless appreciated,&rdquo; she told him primly,
      moving away with her hands full of flowers. &ldquo;If you've got the nerve, come
      inside and read some of my stuff; I want to know if it's any good at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently he was seated upon the couch in the little, pathetically bright
      front room, and he was knitting his eyebrows over Val's beautifully
      regular handwriting,&mdash;pages and pages of it, so that there seemed no
      end to the task,&mdash;and was trying to give his mind to what he was
      reading instead of to the author, sitting near him with her hands folded
      demurely in her lap and her eyes fixed expectantly upon his face, trying
      to read his decision even as it was forming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some verses she had tried on him first. Kent, by using all his
      determination of character, read them all, every word of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's sure all right,&rdquo; he said, though, beyond a telling phrase or two,&mdash;one
      line in particular which would stick in his memory:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;Men live and love and die in that lonely land,&rdquo;&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      he had no very clear idea of what it was all about. Certain lines seemed
      to go bumping along, and one had to mispronounce some of the final words
      to make them rhyme with others gone before, but it was all right&mdash;Val
      wrote it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I do better at stories,&rdquo; she ventured modestly. &ldquo;I wrote one&mdash;a
      little story about university life&mdash;and sent it to a magazine. They
      wrote a lovely letter about it, but it seems that field is overdone, or
      something. The editor asked me why, living out here in the very heart of
      the West, I don't try Western stories. I think I shall&mdash;and that's
      why I said I should need your help. I thought we might work together, you
      know. You've lived here so long, and ought to have some splendid ideas&mdash;things
      that have happened, or that you've heard&mdash;and you could tell me, and
      I'd write them up. Wouldn't you like to collaborate&mdash;'go in cahoots'
      on it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; Kent regarded her thoughtfully. She really was looking brighter
      and happier, and her enthusiasm was not to be mistaken. Her world had
      changed. &ldquo;Anything I can do to help, you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I know, I think it's perfectly splendid, don't you? We'll
      divide the money&mdash;when there <i>is</i> any, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will we?&rdquo; His tone was noncommittal in the extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Now, don't let's quarrel about that till we come to it. I have
      a good idea of my own, I think, for the first story. A man comes out here
      and disappears, you know, and after a while his sister comes to find him.
      She gets into all kinds of trouble&mdash;is kidnapped by a gang of
      robbers, and kept in a cave. When the leader of the gang comes back&mdash;he
      has been away on some depredation&mdash;you see, I have only the bare
      outline of the story yet&mdash;and, well, it's her brother! He kills the
      one who kidnapped her, and she reforms him. Of course, there ought to be
      some love interest. I think, perhaps, one member of the gang ought to fall
      in love with her, don't you know? And after a while he wins her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll reform him, too, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. She couldn't love a man she couldn't respect&mdash;no woman
      could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Kent took a minute to apply that personally. It was of value to him,
      because it was an indication of Val's own code. &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; he suggested
      tentatively, &ldquo;she'd get busy and reform the whole bunch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, say&mdash;that would be great! She's an awfully sweet little thing&mdash;perfectly
      lovely, you know&mdash;and they'd all be in love with her, so it wouldn't
      be improbable. Don't you remember, Kent, you told me once that a man would
      do <i>anything</i> for a woman, if he cared enough for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure. He would, too.&rdquo; Kent fought back a momentary temptation to prove
      the truth of it by his own acquiescence in this pal business. He was saved
      from disaster by a suspicion that Val would not be able to see it from his
      point of view, and by the fact that he would much rather be pals than
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would have gone on, talking and planning and discussing, indefinitely.
      But the sun slid lower and lower, and Kent was not his own master. The
      time came when he had to go, regardless of his own wishes, or hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came again, the story was finished, and Val was waiting, with
      extreme impatience, to read it to him and hear his opinion before she sent
      it away. Kent was not so impatient to hear it, but he did not tell her so.
      He had not seen her for a month, and he wanted to talk; not about anything
      in particular&mdash;just talk about little things, and see her eyes light
      up once in a while, and her lips purse primly when he said something
      daring, and maybe have her play something on the violin, while he smoked
      and watched her slim wrist bend and rise and fall with the movement of the
      bow. He could imagine no single thing more fascinating than that&mdash;that,
      and the way she cuddled the violin under her chin, in the hollow of her
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Val would not play&mdash;she had been too busy to practice, all spring
      and summer; she scarcely ever touched the violin, she said. And she did
      not want to talk&mdash;or if she did, it was plain that she had only one
      theme. So Kent, perforce, listened to the story. Afterward, he assured her
      that it was &ldquo;outa sight.&rdquo; As a matter of fact, half the time he had not
      heard a word of what she was reading; he had been too busy just looking at
      her and being glad he was there. He had, however, a dim impression that it
      was a story with people in it whom one does not try to imagine as ever
      being alive, and with a West which, beyond its evident scarcity of
      inhabitants, was not the West he knew anything about. One paragraph of
      description had caught his attention, because it seemed a fairly accurate
      picture of the bench land which surrounded Cold Spring Coulee; but it had
      not seemed to have anything to do with the story itself. Of course, it
      must be good&mdash;Val wrote it. He began to admire her intensely, quite
      apart from his own personal subjugation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val was pleased with his praise. For two solid hours she talked of nothing
      but that story, and she gave him some fresh chocolate cake and a pitcher
      of lemonade, and urged him to come again in about three weeks, when she
      expected to hear from the magazine she thought would be glad to take the
      story; the one whose editor had suggested that she write of the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fall, and in the winter, their discussions were frequently hampered
      by Manley's presence. But Val's enthusiasm, though nipped here and there
      by unappreciative editors, managed, somehow, to live; or perhaps it had
      developed into a dogged determination to succeed in spite of everything.
      She still wrote things, and she still read them to Kent when there was
      time and opportunity; sometimes he was bold enough to criticize the worst
      places, and to tell her how she might, in his opinion, remedy them.
      Occasionally Val would take his advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the months passed. The winds blew and brought storm and heat and
      sunshine and cloud. Nothing, in that big land, appreciably changed, except
      the people; and they so imperceptibly that they failed to realize it until
      afterward.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. VAL'S DISCOVERY
    </h2>
    <p>
      With a blood-red sun at his back and a rosy tinge upon all the hills
      before him, Manley rode slowly down the western rim of Cold Spring Coulee,
      driving five rebellious calves that had escaped the branding iron in the
      spring. Though they were not easily driven in any given direction, he was
      singularly patient with them, and refrained from bellowing epithets and
      admonitions, as might have been expected. When he was almost down the
      hill, he saw Val standing in the kitchen door, shading her eyes with her
      hands that she might watch his approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open the corral gate!&rdquo; he shouted to her, in the tone of command. &ldquo;And
      stand back where you can head 'em off if they start up the coulee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val replied by doing as she was told; she was not in the habit of wasting
      words upon Manley; they seemed always to precipitate an unpleasant
      discussion of some sort, as if he took it for granted she disapproved of
      all he did or said, and was always upon the defensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The calves came on, lumbering awkwardly in a half-hearted gallop, as if
      they had very little energy left. Their tongues protruded, their mouths
      dribbled a lathery foam, and their rough, sweaty hides told Val of the
      long chase&mdash;for she was wiser in the ways of the range land than she
      had been. She stood back, gently waving her ruffled white apron at them,
      and when they dodged into the corral, rolling eyes at her, she ran up and
      slammed the gate shut upon them, looped the chain around the post, and
      dropped the iron hook into a link to fasten it. Manley galloped up, threw
      himself off his panting horse, and began to unsaddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get some wood and start a fire, and put the iron in, Val,&rdquo; he told her
      brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val looked at him quickly. &ldquo;Now? Supper's all ready, Manley. There's no
      hurry about branding them, is there?&rdquo; And she added: &ldquo;Dear me! The
      round-up must have just skimmed the top off this range last spring. You've
      had to brand a lot of calves that were missed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil is it to you?&rdquo; he demanded roughly. &ldquo;I want that fire,
      madam, and I want it <i>now</i>. I rather think I knew when I want to
      brand without asking your advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val curved her lips scornfully, shrugged and obeyed She was used to that
      sort of thing, and she did not mind very much. He had brutalized by
      degrees, and by degrees she had hardened. He could rouse no feeling now
      but contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you'll kindly wait until I put back the supper,&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;I
      suppose in your zeal one need not sacrifice your food; you're still rather
      particular about that. I observe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manley was leading his horse to the stable, and, though he answered
      something, the words were no more than a surly mumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's been drinking again,&rdquo; Val decided dispassionately, on the way to the
      house. &ldquo;I suppose he carried a bottle in his pocket&mdash;and emptied it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was not long; there was a penalty of profane reproach attached to
      delay, however slight, when Manley was in that mood. She had the fire
      going and the VP iron heating by the time he had stabled and fed his
      horse, and had driven the calves into the smaller pen. He drove a big,
      line-backed heifer into a corner, roped and tied her down with surprising
      dexterity, and turned impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! Isn't that iron ready yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val, on the other side of the fence, drew it out and inspected it
      indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not, Mr. Fleetwood. If you are in a very great hurry, why not apply
      your temper to it&mdash;and a few choice remarks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't try to be sarcastic&mdash;it's too pathetic. Kick a little life
      into that fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;thank you, sir.&rdquo; Val could be rather exasperating when she
      chose. She always could be sure of making Manley silently furious when she
      adopted that tone of respectful servility&mdash;as employed by butlers and
      footmen upon the stage. Her mimicry, be it said, was very good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ere it is, sir&mdash;&mdash;thank you, sir&mdash;'ope I 'aven't kept you
      wyting, sir,&rdquo; she announced, after he had fumed for two minutes inside the
      corral, and she had cynically hummed her way quite through the hymn which
      begins &ldquo;Blest be the tie that binds.&rdquo; She passed the white-hot iron deftly
      through the rails to him, and fixed the fire for another heating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Really, she was not thinking of Manley at all, nor of his mood, nor of his
      brutal coarseness. She was thinking of the rebuilt typewriter, advertised
      as being exactly as good as a new one, and scandalously cheap, for which
      she had sold her watch to Arline Hawley to get money to buy. She was
      counting mentally the days since she had sent the money order, and was
      thinking it should come that week surely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was also planning to seize upon the opportunity afforded by Manley's
      next absence for a day from the ranch, and drive to Hope on the chance of
      getting the machine. Only&mdash;she wished she could be sure whether Kent
      would be coming soon. She did not want to miss seeing him; she decided to
      sound Polycarp Jenks the next time he came. Polycarp would know, of
      course, whether the Wishbone outfit was in from round-up. Polycarp always
      knew everything that had been done, or was intended, among the neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manley passed the ill-smelling iron back to her, and she put it in the
      fire, quite mechanically. It was not the first time, nor the second, that
      she had been called upon to help brand. She could heat an iron as quickly
      and evenly as most men, though Manley had never troubled to tell her so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five times she heated the iron, and heard, with an inward quiver of pity
      and disgust, the spasmodic blat of the calf in the pen when the VP went
      searing into the hide on its ribs. She did not see why they must be
      branded that evening, in particular, but it was as well to have it done
      with. Also, if Manley meant to wean them, she would have to see that they
      were fed and watered, she supposed. That would make her trip to town a
      hurried one, if she went at all; she would have to go and come the same
      day, and Arline Hawley would scold and beg her to stay, and call her a
      fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, how about that supper?&rdquo; asked Manley, when they were through, and
      the air was clearing a little from the smoke and the smell of burned hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don't know&mdash;I smelled the potatoes burning some time ago.
      I'll see, however.&rdquo; She brushed her hands with her handkerchief, pushed
      back the lock of hair that was always falling across her temple, and,
      because she was really offended by Manley's attitude and tone, she sang
      softly all the way to the house, merely to conceal from him the fact that
      he could move her even to irritation. Her best weapon, she had discovered
      long ago, was absolute indifference&mdash;the indifference which
      overlooked his presence and was deaf to his recriminations.
    </p>
    <p>
      She completed her preparations for his supper, made sure that nothing was
      lacking and that the tea was just right, placed his chair in position,
      filled the water glass beside his plate, set the tea-pot where he could
      reach it handily, and went into the living room and closed the door
      between. In the past year, filed as it had been with her literary
      ambitions and endeavors, she had neglected her music; but she took her
      violin from the box, hunted the cake of resin, tuned the strings, and,
      when she heard him come into the kitchen and sit down at the table, seated
      herself upon the front doorstep and began to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one bit of music which Manley thoroughly detested. That was the
      &ldquo;Traumerei.&rdquo; Therefore, she played the &ldquo;Traumerei&rdquo; slowly&mdash;as it
      should, of course, be played&mdash;with full value given to all the
      pensive, long-drawn notes, and with a finale positively creepy in its
      dreamy wistfulness. Val, as has been stated, could be very exasperating
      when she chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the kitchen there was the subdued rattle of dishes, unbroken and
      unhurried. Val went on playing, but she forgot that she had begun in a
      half-conscious desire to annoy her husband. She stared dreamily at the
      hill which shut out the world to the east, and yielded to a mood of
      loneliness; of longing, in the abstract, for all the pleasant things she
      was missing in this life which she had chosen in her ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Manley flung open the inner door, she gave a stifled exclamation; she
      had forgotten all about Manley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all the big and little gods of Greece!&rdquo; he swore angrily. &ldquo;Calves
      bawling their heads off in the corral, and you squalling that whiny stuff
      you call music in the house&mdash;home's sure a hell of a happy place! I'm
      going to town. You don't want to leave the place till I come back&mdash;I
      want those calves looked after.&rdquo; He seemed to consider something mentally,
      and then added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I'm not back before they quit bawling, you can turn 'em down in the
      river field with the rest. You know when they're weaned and ready to
      settle down. Don't feed 'em too much hay, like you did that other bunch;
      just give 'em what they need; you don't have to pile the corral full. And
      don't keep 'em shut up an hour longer than necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val nodded her head to show that she heard, and went on playing. There was
      seldom any pretense of good feeling between them now. She tuned the violin
      to minor, and poised the bow over the strings, in some doubt as to her
      memory of a serenade she wanted to try next.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I have Polycarp take the team and haul up some wood from the
      river?&rdquo; she asked carelessly. &ldquo;We're nearly out again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>I</i> don't care&mdash;if he happens along.&rdquo; He turned and went
      out, his mind turning eagerly to the town and what it could give him in
      the way of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val, still sitting in the doorway, saw him ride away up the grade and
      disappear over the brow of the hill. The dusk was settling softly upon the
      land, so that his figure was but a vague shape. She was alone again; she
      rather liked being alone, now that she had no longer a blind, unreasoning
      terror of the empty land. She had her thoughts and her work; the presence
      of Manley was merely an unpleasant interruption to both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time in the night she heard the lowing of a cow somewhere near. She
      wondered dreamily what it could be doing in the coulee, and went to sleep
      again. The five calves were all bawling in a chorus of complaint against
      their forced separation from their mothers, and the deeper, throaty tones
      of the cow mingled not inharmoniously with the sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Range cattle were not permitted in the coulee, and when by chance they
      found a broken panel in the fence and strayed down there, Val drove them
      out; afoot, usually, with shouts and badly aimed stones to accelerate
      their lumbering pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      After she had eaten her breakfast in the morning she went out to
      investigate. Beyond the corral, her nose thrust close against the rails, a
      cow was bawling dismally. Inside, in much the same position, its tail
      waving a violent signal of its owner's distress, a calf was clamoring
      hysterically for its mother and its mother's milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val sympathized with them both; but the cow did not belong in the coulee,
      and she gathered two or three small stones and went around where she could
      frighten her away from the fence without, however, exposing herself too
      recklessly to her uncertain temper. Cows at weaning time did sometimes
      object to being driven from their calves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shoo! Go on away from there!&rdquo; Val raised a stone and poised it
      threateningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cow turned and regarded her, wild-eyed. It backed a step or two,
      evidently uncertain of its next move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on away!&rdquo; Val was just on the point of throwing the rock, when she
      dropped it unheeded to the ground and stared. &ldquo;Why, you&mdash;you&mdash;why&mdash;the
      <i>idea!</i>&rdquo; She turned slowly white. Certain things must filter to the
      understanding through amazement and disbelief; it took Val a minute or two
      to grasp the significance of what she saw. By the time she did grasp it,
      her knees were beading weakly beneath the weight of her body. She put out
      a groping hand and caught at the corner of the corral to keep herself from
      falling. And she stared and stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&mdash;oh, surely not!&rdquo; she whispered, protesting against her
      understanding. She gave a little sob that had no immediate relation to
      tears. &ldquo;Surely&mdash;<i>surely</i>&mdash;not!&rdquo; It was of no use;
      understanding came, and came clearly, pitilessly. Many things&mdash;trifles,
      all of them&mdash;to which she had given no thought at the time, or which
      she had forgotten immediately, came back to her of their own accord;
      things she tried <i>not</i> to remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cow stared at her for a minute, and, when she made no hostile move,
      turned its attention back to its bereavement. Once again it thrust its
      moist muzzle between two rails, gave a preliminary, vibrant <i>mmm&mdash;mmmmm&mdash;m</i>,
      and then, with a spasmodic heaving of ribs and of flank, burst into a
      long-drawn <i>baww&mdash;aw&mdash;aw&mdash;aw</i>, which rose rapidly in a
      tremulous crescendo and died to a throaty rumbling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val started nervously, though her eyes were fixed upon the cow and she
      knew the sound was coming. It served, however, to release her from the
      spell of horror which had gripped her. She was still white, and when she
      moved she felt intolerably heavy, so that her feet dragged; but she was no
      longer dazed. She went slowly around to the gate, reached up wearily and
      undid the chain fastening, opened the gate slightly, and went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four of the calves were huddled together for mutual comfort in a corner.
      They were blatting indefatigably. Val went over to where the fifth one
      still stood beside the fence, as near the cow as it could get, and threw a
      small stone, that bounced off the calf's rump. The calf jumped and ran
      aimlessly before her until it reached the half-open gate, when it dodged
      out, as if it could scarcely believe its own good fortune. Before Val
      could follow it outside, it was nuzzling rapturously its mother, and the
      cow was contorting her body so that she could caress her offspring with
      her tongue, while she rumbled her satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val closed and fastened the gate carefully, and went back to where the cow
      still lingered. With her lips drawn to a thin, colorless line, she drove
      her across the coulee and up the hill, the calf gamboling close alongside.
      When they had gone out of sight, up on the level, Val turned back and went
      slowly to the house. She stood for a minute staring stupidly at it and at
      the coulee, went in and gazed around her with that blankness which follows
      a great mental shock. After a minute she shivered, threw up her hands
      before her face, and dropped, a pitiful, sorrowing heap of quivering
      rebellion, upon the couch.

      Polycarp Jenks came ambling into the coulee, rapped perfunctorily upon the
      door-casing, and entered the kitchen as one who feels perfectly at home,
      and sure of his welcome; as was not unfitting, considering the fact that
      he had &ldquo;chored around&rdquo; for Val during the last year, and longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody to home?&rdquo; he called, seeing the front door shut tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a stir within, and Val, still pale, and with an almost furtive
      expression in her eyes, opened the door and looked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's you, Polycarp,&rdquo; she said lifelessly. &ldquo;Is there anything&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter? Sick? You look kinda peaked and frazzled out. I met
      Man las' night, and he told me you needed wood; I thought I'd ride over
      and see. By granny, you do look bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a headache,&rdquo; Val evaded, shrinking back guiltily. &ldquo;Just do whatever
      there is to do, Polycarp. I think&mdash;I don't believe the chickens have
      had anything to eat to-day&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them headaches are sure a fright; they're might' nigh as bad as
      rheumatiz, when they hit you hard. You jest go back and lay down, and I'll
      look around and see what they is to do. Any idee when Man's comin' back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Val brought the word out with an involuntary sharpness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I reckon not. I hear him and Fred De Garmo come might' near havin' a
      fight las' night. Blumenthall was tellin' me this mornin'. Fred's quit the
      Double Diamond, I hear. He's got himself appointed dep'ty stock inspector&mdash;and
      how he managed to git the job is more 'n I can figure out. They say he's
      all swelled up over it&mdash;got his headquarters in town, you know, and
      seems he got to lordin' it over Man las' night, and I guess if somebody
      hadn't stopped 'em they'd of been a mix-up, all right. Man wasn't in no
      shape to fight&mdash;he'd been drinkin' pretty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;well, just do whatever there is to do, Polycarp. The horses are
      in the upper pasture, I think&mdash;if you want to haul wood.&rdquo; She closed
      the door&mdash;gently, but with exceeding firmness, and, Polycarp took the
      hint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women is queer,&rdquo; he muttered, as he left the house. &ldquo;Now, she knows Man
      drinks like a fish&mdash;and she knows everybody else knows it&mdash;but
      if you so much as mention sech a thing, why&mdash;&rdquo; He waggled his head
      disapprovingly and proceeded, in his habitually laborious manner, to take
      a chew of tobacco. &ldquo;No matter how much they may know a thing is so, if it
      don't suit 'em you can't never git 'em to stand right up and face it out&mdash;seems
      like, by granny, it comes natural to 'em to make believe things is
      different. Now, she knows might' well she can't fool <i>me</i>. I've hearn
      Man swear at her like&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reached the corral, and his insatiable curiosity turned his thoughts
      into a different channel. He inspected the four calves gravely, wondered
      audibly where Man had found them, and how the round-up came to miss them,
      and criticized his application of the brand; in the opinion of Polycarp,
      Manley either burned too deep or not deep enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time that line-backed heifer scabs off, you can't tell what's on her,&rdquo; he
      asserted, expectorating solemnly before he turned away to his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prom a window, Val watched him with cold terror. Would he suspect? Or was
      there anything to suspect? &ldquo;It's silly&mdash;it's perfectly idiotic,&rdquo; she
      told herself impatiently; &ldquo;but if he hangs around that corral another
      minute, I shall scream!&rdquo; She watched until she saw him mount his horse and
      ride off toward the upper pasture. Then she went out and began
      apathetically picking seed pods off her sweet-peas, which the early frosts
      had spared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Head better?&rdquo; called Polycarp, half an hour later, when he went rattling
      past the house with the wagon, bound for the river bottom where they got
      their supply of wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little,&rdquo; Val answered inattentively, without looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was while Polycarp was after the wood, and while she was sitting upon
      the edge of the porch, listlessly arranging and rearranging a handful of
      long-stemmed blossoms, that Kent galloped down the hill and up to the
      gate. She saw him coming and set her teeth hard together. She did not want
      to see Kent just then; she did not want to see anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent, however, wanted to see her. It seemed to him at least a month since
      he had had a glimpse of her, though it was no more than half that time. He
      watched her covertly while he came up the path. His mind, all the way over
      from the Wishbone, had been very clear and very decided. He had a certain
      thing to tell her, and a certain thing to do; he had thought it all out
      during the nights when he could not sleep and the days when men called him
      surly, and there was no going back, no reconsideration of the matter. He
      had been telling himself that, over and over, ever since the house came
      into view and he saw her sitting there on the porch. She would probably
      want to argue, and perhaps she would try to persuade him, but it would be
      absolutely useless; absolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hello!&rdquo; he cried, with more than his usual buoyancy of manner&mdash;because
      he knew he must hurt her later on. &ldquo;Hello, Madam Authoress. Why this
      haughty air? This stuckupiness? Shall I get a ladder and climb up where
      you can hear me say howdy?&rdquo; He took off his hat and slapped her gently
      upon the top of her head with it. &ldquo;Come out of the fog!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;I wish you wouldn't!&rdquo; She glanced up at him so briefly that he
      caught only a flicker of her yellow-brown eyes, and went on fumbling her
      flowers. Kent stood and looked down at her for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mad?&rdquo; he inquired cheerfully. &ldquo;Say, you look awfully savage. On the dead,
      you do. What do <i>you</i> care if they sent it back? You had all the fun
      of writing it&mdash;and you know it's a dandy. Please smile. <i>Pretty</i>
      please!&rdquo; he wheedled. It was not the first time he had discovered her in a
      despondent mood, nor the first time he had bantered and badgered her out
      of her gloom. Presently it dawned upon him that this was more serious; he
      had never seen her quite so colorless or so completely without spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sick, pal?&rdquo; he asked gently, sitting down beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o&mdash;I suppose not.&rdquo; Val bit her lips, as soon as she had spoken,
      to check their quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is it? I wish you'd tell me. I came over here full of
      something I had to tell you&mdash;but I can't, now; not while you're like
      this.&rdquo; He watched her yearningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can't tell you. It's nothing.&rdquo; Val jerked a sweet-pea viciously
      from its stem, pressed her hand against her mouth, and turned reluctantly
      toward him. &ldquo;What was it you came to tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He watched her narrowly. &ldquo;I'll gamble you're down in the mouth about
      something hubby has said or done. You needn't tell me&mdash;but I just
      want to ask you if you think it's worth while? You needn't tell me that,
      either. You know blamed well it ain't. He can't deal you any more misery
      than you let him hand out; you want to keep that in mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another blossom was demolished. &ldquo;What was it you came to tell me?&rdquo; she
      repeated steadily, though she did not look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing much. I'm going to leave the country, is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kent!&rdquo; After a minute she forced another word out. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent regarded her somberly. &ldquo;You better think twice before you ask me
      that,&rdquo; he warned; &ldquo;because I ain't much good at beating all around the
      bush. If you ask me again, I'll tell you&mdash;and I'm liable to tell you
      without any frills.&rdquo; He drew a hard breath. &ldquo;So I'd advise you not to
      ask,&rdquo; he finished, half challengingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val placed a pale lavender blossom against a creamy white one, and held
      the two up for inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When are you going?&rdquo; she asked evenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know exactly&mdash;in a day or so. Saturday, maybe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated over the flowers in her lap, and selected a pink one, which
      she tried with the white and the lavender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;<i>why</i> are you going?&rdquo; she asked him deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent stared at her fixedly. A faint, pink flush was creeping into her
      cheeks. He watched it deepen, and knew that his silence was filling her
      with uneasiness. He wondered how much she guessed of what he was going to
      say, and how much it would mean to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right&mdash;I'll tell you why, fast enough.&rdquo; His tone was grim. &ldquo;I'm
      going to leave the country because I can't stay any longer&mdash;not while
      you're in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;Kent!&rdquo; She seemed inexpressibly shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; he went on relentlessly, &ldquo;what you think a man's made of,
      anyhow. And I don't know what <i>you</i> think of this pal business; I
      know what I think: It's a mighty good way to drive a man crazy. I've had
      about all of it I can stand, if you want to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry, if you don't&mdash;if you can't be friends any longer,&rdquo; she
      said, and he winced to see how her eyes filled with tears. &ldquo;But, of
      course, if you can't&mdash;if it bores you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent seized her arm, a bit roughly, &ldquo;Have I got to come right out and tell
      you, in plain English, that I&mdash;that it's because I'm so deep in love
      with you I can't. If you only knew what it's cost me this last year&mdash;to
      play the game and not play it too hard! What do you think a man's made of?
      Do you think a man can care for a woman, like I care for you, and&mdash;Do
      you think he wants to be just pals? And stand back and watch some drunken
      brute abuse her&mdash;and never&mdash;Here!&rdquo; His voice grew testier.
      &ldquo;Don't do that&mdash;don't! I didn't want to hurt you&mdash;God knows I
      didn't want to hurt you!&rdquo; He threw his seem around her shoulders and
      pulled her toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't&mdash;pal, I'm a brute, I guess, like all the rest of the male
      humans. I don't mean to be&mdash;it's the way I'm made. When a woman means
      so much to me that I can't think of anything else, day or night, and get
      to counting days and scheming to see her&mdash;why&mdash;being friends&mdash;like
      we've been&mdash;is like giving a man a teaspoon of milk and water when
      he's starving to death, and thinking that oughta do. But I shouldn't have
      let it hurt you. I tried to stand for it, little woman. These were times
      when I just had to fight myself not to take you up in my arms and carry
      you of and keep you. You must admit,&rdquo; he argued, smiling rather wanly,
      &ldquo;that, considering how I've felt about it, I've done pretty tolerable well
      up till now. You don't&mdash;you never will know how much it's cost. Why,
      my nerves are getting so raw I can't stand anything any more. That's why
      I'm going. I don't want to hang around till I do something&mdash;foolish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took his arm away from her shoulders and moved farther off; he was not
      sure how far he might trust himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I thought you cared&mdash;or if there was anything I could do for
      you,&rdquo; he ventured, after a moment, &ldquo;why, it would be different. But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val lifted her head and turned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something&mdash;or there was&mdash;or&mdash;oh, I can't think
      any more! I suppose&rdquo;&mdash;doubtfully&mdash;&ldquo;if you feel as you say you
      do, why&mdash;it would be&mdash;wicked to stay. But you don't; you must
      just imagine it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; Kent interpolated ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you go away&mdash;&rdquo; She got up and stood before him, breathing
      unevenly, in little gasps. &ldquo;Oh, you mustn't go away! Please don't go! I&mdash;there's
      something terrible happened&mdash;oh, Kent, I need you! I can't tell you
      what it is&mdash;it's the most horrible thing I ever heard of! You can't
      imagine anything more horrible, Kent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She twisted her fingers together nervously, and the blossoms dropped, one
      by one, on the ground. &ldquo;If you go,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;I won't have a friend in
      the country, not a real friend. And&mdash;and I never needed a friend as
      much as I do now, and you mustn't go. I&mdash;I can't let you go!&rdquo; It was
      like her hysterical fear of being left alone after the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent eyed her keenly. He knew there must have been something to put her
      into this state&mdash;something more than his own rebellion. He felt
      suddenly ashamed of his weakness in giving way&mdash;in telling her how it
      was with him. The faint, far-off chuckle of a wagon came to his ears. He
      turned impatiently toward the sound. Polycarp was driving up the coulee
      with a load of wood; already he was nearing the gate which opened into the
      lower field. Kent stood up, reached out, and caught Val by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on into the house,&rdquo; he said peremptorily. &ldquo;Polly's coming, and you
      don't want him goggling and listening. And I want you,&rdquo; he added, when he
      had led her inside and closed the door, &ldquo;to tell me what all this is
      about. There's something, and I want to know what. If it concerns you,
      then it concerns me a whole lot, too. And what concerns me I'm going to
      find out about&mdash;what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val sat down, got up immediately, and crossed the room aimlessly to sit in
      another chair. She pressed her palms tightly against both cheeks, drew in
      her breath as if she were going to speak, and, after all, said nothing.
      She looked out of the window, pushing back the errant strand of hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't&mdash;I don't know how to tell you,&rdquo; she began desperately. &ldquo;It's
      too horrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe it is&mdash;I don't know what you'd call too horrible; I kinda
      think it wouldn't be what I'd tack those words to. Anyway&mdash;what is
      it?&rdquo; He went close, and he spoke insistently.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manley's a thief!&rdquo; She jerked the words out like as automaton. They were
      not, evidently, the Words she had meant to speak, for she seemed
      frightened afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's it!&rdquo; Kent made a sound which was not far from a snort. &ldquo;Well,
      what about it? What's he done? How did you find it out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val straightened in the chair and gazed up at him. Once more her tawny
      eyes gave him a certain shock, as if he had never before noticed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all our neighbors have done for him,&rdquo; she cried bitterly; &ldquo;after
      giving him hay, when his was burned and he couldn't buy any; after
      building stables, and corral, and&mdash;everything they did&mdash;the
      kindest, best neighbors a man ever had&mdash;oh, it's too shameful for
      utterance! I might forgive it&mdash;I might, only for that. The&mdash;the
      ingratitude! It's too despicable&mdash;too&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent laid a steadying hand upon her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but what is it?&rdquo; he interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val shook off his hand unconsciously, impatient of any touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the bare deed itself&mdash;well, it's rather petty, too&mdash;and
      cheap.&rdquo; Her voice became full of contempt. &ldquo;It was the calves. He brought
      home five last night&mdash;five that hadn't been branded last spring.
      Where he found them <i>I</i> don't know&mdash;I didn't care enough about
      it to ask. He had been drinking, I think; I can usually tell&mdash;and he
      often carries a bottle in his pocket, as I happen to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he had me make a fire and heat the iron for him, and he branded
      them&mdash;last night; he was very touchy about it when I asked him what
      was his hurry. I think now it was a stupid thing for him to do. And&mdash;well,
      in the night, some time, I heard a cow bawling around close, and this
      morning I went out to drive her away; the fence is always down somewhere&mdash;I
      suppose she found a place to get through. So I went out to drive her
      away.&rdquo; Her eyes dropped, as if she were making a confession of her own
      misdeed. She clenched her hands tightly in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;it was a Wishbone cow.&rdquo; After all, she said it very quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil it was!&rdquo; Kent had been prepared for something of the sort; but,
      nevertheless, he started when he heard his own outfit mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It was a Wishbone cow.&rdquo; Her voice was flat and monotonous. &ldquo;He had
      stolen her calf. He had it in the corral, and he had branded it with his
      own brand&mdash;with a VP. <i>With my initials!</i>&rdquo; she wailed suddenly,
      as if the thought had just struck her, and was intolerably bitter. &ldquo;She
      had followed&mdash;had been hunting her calf; it was rather a little calf,
      smaller than the others. And it was crowded up against the fence, trying
      to get to her. There was no mistaking their relationship. I tried to think
      he had made a mistake; but it's of no use&mdash;I know he didn't. I know
      he <i>stole</i> that calf. And for all I know, the others, too. Oh, it's
      perfectly horrible to think of!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent could easily guess her horror of it, and he was sorry for her. But
      his mind turned instantly to the practical side of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;maybe it can be fixed up, if you feel so bad about it. Does
      Polycarp&mdash;did he see the cow hanging around?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val shook her head apathetically. &ldquo;No&mdash;he didn't come till just a
      little while ago. That was this morning. And I drove her out of the coulee&mdash;her
      and her calf. They went off up over the hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent stood looking down at her rather stupidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;<i>what?</i> What was it you did?&rdquo; It seemed to him that
      something&mdash;some vital point of the story&mdash;had eluded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I drove them away. I didn't think they ought to be permitted to hang
      around here.&rdquo; Her lips quivered again. &ldquo;I&mdash;I didn't want to see him&mdash;get&mdash;into
      any trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You drove them away? Both of them?&rdquo; Kent was frowning at her now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val sprang up and faced him, all a-tremble with indignation. &ldquo;Certainly,
      both! <i>I'm</i> not a thief, Kent Burnett! When I knew&mdash;when there
      was no possible doubt&mdash;why, what, in Heaven's name, <i>could</i> I
      do? It wasn't Manley's calf. I turned it loose to go back where it
      belonged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a VP on its ribs!&rdquo; Kent was staring at her curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't care! Fifty VP's couldn't make the calf Manley's. If
      anybody came and saw that cow, why&mdash;&rdquo; Val looked at him rafter
      pityingly, as if she could not quite understand how he could even question
      her upon that point. &ldquo;And, after all,&rdquo; she added forlornly, &ldquo;he's my
      husband. I couldn't&mdash;I had to do what I could to shield him&mdash;just
      for sake of the past, I suppose. Much as I despise him, I can't forget
      that&mdash;that I cared once. It's because I wanted your advice that I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a pity you didn't get it sooner, then! Can't you see what you've
      done? Why, think a minute! A VP calf running with a Wishbone cow&mdash;why,
      it's&mdash;you couldn't advertise Man as a rustler any better if you
      tried. The first fellow that runs onto that cow and calf&mdash;well, he
      won't need to do any guessing&mdash;he'll <i>know</i>. It's a ticket to
      Deer Lodge&mdash;that VP calf. Now do you see?&rdquo; He turned away to the
      window and stood looking absently at the brown hillside, his hands thrust
      deep into his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there's Fred De Garmo, with his new job, ranging around the country
      just aching to cinch somebody and show his authority. It's a matter of
      days almost. He'd like nothing better than to get a whack at Man, even if
      the Wishbone&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Outside, they could hear Polycarp throwing the wood off the wagon; knowing
      him as they did, they knew, it would not be long before he found an excuse
      for coming into the house. He had more than once evinced a good deal of
      interest in Kent's visits there, and shown an unmistakable desire to know
      what they were talking about. They had never paid much attention to him;
      but now even Val felt a vague uneasiness lest he overhear. She had been
      sitting, her face buried in her arms, crushed beneath the knowledge of
      what she had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't worry, little woman.&rdquo; Kent went over and passed his hand lightly
      over her hair. &ldquo;You did what looked to you to be the right thing&mdash;the
      honest thing. And the chances are he'd get caught before long, anyhow. I
      don't reckon this is the first time he's done it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh-h&mdash;but to think&mdash;to think that <i>I</i> should do it&mdash;when
      I wanted to save him! He&mdash;Kent, I despise him&mdash;he has killed all
      the love I ever felt for him&mdash;killed it over and over&mdash;but if
      anybody finds that calf, and&mdash;and if they&mdash;Kent, I shall go
      crazy if I have to feel that <i>I</i> sent him&mdash;to&mdash;prison. To
      think of him&mdash;shut up there&mdash;and to know that I did it&mdash;I
      can't bear it!&rdquo; She caught his arm. She pressed her forehead against it.
      &ldquo;Kent, isn't there some way to get it back? If I should find it&mdash;and&mdash;and
      shoot it&mdash;and pay the Wishbone what it's worth&mdash;oh, <i>any</i>
      amount&mdash;or shoot the cow&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo; she raised her face
      imploringly to his&mdash;&ldquo;tell me, pal&mdash;or I shall go stark, raving
      mad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Polycarp came into the kitchen, and, from the sound, he was trying to
      enter as unobtrusively as possible, even to the extent of walking on his
      toes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go see what that darned old sneak wants,&rdquo; Kent commanded in an undertone.
      &ldquo;Act as if nothing happened&mdash;if you can.&rdquo; He watched anxiously, while
      she drew a long breath, pressed her hands hard against her cheeks, closed
      her lips tightly, and then, with something like composure, went quietly to
      the door and threw it open. Polycarp was standing very close to it, on the
      other side. He drew back a step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wondered if I better git another load, now I've got the team hooked
      up,&rdquo; he began in his rasping, nasal voice, his slitlike eyes peering
      inquisitively into the room. &ldquo;Hello, Kenneth&mdash;I <i>thought</i> that
      was your horse standin' outside. Or would you rather I cut up a pile? I
      dunno but what I'll have to go t'town t'-morrerr or next day&mdash;mebby I
      better cut you some wood, hey? If Man ain't likely to be home, mebby&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, Polycarp, well have a storm soon. So it would be good policy to
      haul another load, don't you think? I can manage very well with what there
      is cut until Manley returns; and there are always small branches that I
      can break easily with the axe. I really think it would be safer to have
      another load hauled now while we can. Don't you think so?&rdquo; Val even
      managed to smile at him. &ldquo;If my head wasn't so bad,&rdquo; she added
      deceitfully, &ldquo;I should be tempted to go along, just for a dose sight of
      the river. Mr. Burnett is going directly&mdash;perhaps I may walk down
      later on. But you had better not wait&mdash;I shouldn't want to keep you
      working till dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Polycarp, eying her and Kent, and the room in all its details, forced his
      hand into his trousers pocket, brought up his battered plug of tobacco and
      pried off a piece, which he rolled into his left cheek with his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest as you say,&rdquo; he surrendered, though it was perfectly plain that he
      would much prefer to cut wood and so be able to see all that went on, even
      though he was denied the gratification of hearing what they said. He
      waited a moment, but Val turned away, and even had the audacity to close
      the door upon his unfinished reply. He listened for a moment, his head
      craned forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Purty kinda goings-on!&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;Time Man had a flea put in 'is ear,
      by granny, if he don't want to lose that yeller-eyed wife of hisn.&rdquo; To
      Polycarp, a closed door&mdash;when a man and woman were alone upon the
      other side&mdash;could mean nothing but surreptitious kisses and the like.
      He went stumbling out and drove away down the coulee, his head turning
      automatically so that his eyes were constantly upon the house; from his
      attitude, as Kent saw him through the window Polycarp expected an
      explosion, at the very least. His outraged virtue vested itself in one
      more sentence; &ldquo;Purty blamed nervy, by granny&mdash;to go 'n' shut the
      door right in m' face!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Inside the room, Val stood for a minute with her back against the door, as
      if she half feared Polycarp would break in and drag her secret from her.
      When she heard him leave the kitchen she drew a long breath, eloquent in
      itself: when the rattle of the wagon came to them there, she left the door
      and went slowly across the room until she stood close to Kent. The
      interruption had steadied them both. Her voice was a constrained calm when
      she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      {Illustration: To draw the red hot spur across the fresh VP did not take
      long}
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;is there anything I can do? Because I suppose every minute is
      dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent kept his eyes upon the departing Polycarp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing you can do, no. Maybe I can do something; soon as that
      granny gossip is outa sight, I'll go and round up that cow and calf&mdash;if
      somebody hasn't beaten me to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val looked at him with a certain timid helplessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Will you&mdash;won't it be against the law if you&mdash;if you kill
      it?&rdquo; She grew slightly excited again. &ldquo;Kent, you shall not get into any
      trouble for&mdash;for his sake! If it comes to a choice, why&mdash;let him
      suffer for his crime. You shall not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent turned his head slowly and gazed down at her. &ldquo;Don't run away with
      the idea I'm doing it for him,&rdquo; he told her distinctly. &ldquo;I love Man
      Fleetwood like I love a wolf. But if that VP calf catches him up, you'd
      fight your head over it, God only knows how long. I know you! You'd think
      so much about the part you played that you'd wind up by forgetting
      everything else. You'd get to thinking of him as a martyr, maybe! No&mdash;it's
      for you. I kinda got you into this, you recollect? If I'd let you see Man
      drank, that day, you'd never have married him; I know that now. So I'm
      going to get you out of it. My side of the question can wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stared up at him with a grave understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know what I said&mdash;you won't do anything that can make you
      trouble&mdash;won't you tell me, Kent, what you're going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had already started to the door, but he stopped and smiled
      reassuringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing so fierce. If I can find 'em, I aim to bar out that VP. Sabe?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. A BLOTCHED BRAND
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the brow of the hill, which was the western rim of the coulee, Kent
      turned and waved a farewell to Val, watching him wistfully from the
      kitchen door. She had wanted to go along; she had almost cried to go and
      help, but Kent would not permit her&mdash;and beneath the unpleasantness
      of denying her anything, there had been a certain primitive joy in feeling
      himself master of the situation and of her actions; for that one time it
      was as if she belonged to him. At the last he had accepted the field
      glasses, which she insisted upon lending him, and now he was tempted to
      take them from their worn, leathern case and focus them upon her face,
      just for the meager satisfaction of one more look at her. But he rode on,
      oat of sight, for the necessity which drove him forth did not permit much
      loitering if he would succeed in what he had set out to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personally he would have felt no compunctions whatever about letting the
      calf go, a walking advertisement of Manley's guilt. It seemed to him a
      sort of grim retribution, and no more than he deserved. He had not
      exaggerated his sentiments when he intimated plainly to her his hatred of
      Manley, and he agreed with her that the fellow was making a despicable
      return for the kindness his neighbors had always shown him. No doubt he
      had stolen from the Double Diamond as well as the Wishbone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once Kent pulled up, half minded to go back and let events shape
      themselves without any interference from him. But there was Val&mdash;women
      were so queer about such things. It seemed to Kent that, if any man had
      caused him as much misery as Manley had caused Val, he would not waste
      much time worrying over him, if he tangled himself up with his own
      misdeeds. However, Val wanted that bit of evidence covered up; so, while
      Kent did not approve, he went at the business with his customary
      thoroughness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The field glasses were a great convenience. More than once they saved him
      the trouble of riding a mile or so to inspect a small bunch of stock.
      Nevertheless, he rode for several hours before, just at sundown, he
      discovered the cow feeding alone with her calf in a shallow depression
      near the rough country next the river. They were wild, and he ran them out
      of the hollow and up on high ground before he managed to drop his loop
      over the calf's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sure are a dandy-fine sign-post, all right,&rdquo; he observed, and grinned
      down at the staring VP brand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a pity you can't be left that way.&rdquo; He glanced cautiously around him
      at the great, empty prairie. A mile or two away, a lone horseman was
      loping leisurely along, evidently bound for the Double Diamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say&mdash;this is kinda public,&rdquo; Kent complained to the calf. &ldquo;Let's you
      and me go down outa sight for a minute.&rdquo; He started off toward the hollow,
      dragging the calf, a protesting bundle of stiffened muscles pulling
      against the rope. The cow, shaking her head in a halfhearted defiance,
      followed. Kent kept an uneasy eye upon the horseman, and hoped fervently
      the fellow was absorbed in meditation and, would not glance in his
      direction. Once he was almost at the point of turning the calf loose; for
      barring out brands, even illegal brands, is justly looked upon with
      disfavor, to say the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down in the hollow, which Kent reached with a sigh of relief, he
      dismounted and hastily started a little fire on a barren patch of ground
      beneath a jutting sandstone ledge. The calf, tied helpless, lay near by,
      and the cow hovered close, uneasy, but lacking courage for a rush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent laid hand upon his saddle, hesitated, and shook his head; he might
      need it in a hurry, and cinch ring takes time both in the removal and the
      replacement&mdash;and is vitally important withal. His knife he had lost
      on the last round-up. He scowled at the necessity, lifted his heel, and
      took off a spur. &ldquo;And if that darned ginny don't get too blamed curious
      and cone fogging over this way&mdash;&rdquo; He spoke the phrase aloud, out of
      the middle of a mental arrangement of the chance he was taking.
    </p>
    <p>
      To heat the spur red-hot, draw it across the fresh VP again and again, and
      finally drag it crisscross once or twice to make assurance an absolute
      certainty, did not take long. Kent was particular about not wasting any
      seconds. The calf stopped its dismal blatting, and when Kent released it
      and coiled his rope, it jumped up and ran for its life, the cows ambling
      solicitously at its heels. Kent kicked the dirt over the fire, eyed it
      sharply a moment to make sure it was perfectly harmless, mounted in haste,
      and rode up the sloping side down, which he had come. Just under the top
      of the slope, he peeked anxiously out over the prairie, ducked
      precipitately, and went clattering away down the hollow to the farther
      side; dodged around a spur of rocks, forced his horse down over a wicked
      jumble of boulders to level land below, and rode as if a hangman's noose
      were the penalty for delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the river&mdash;which he did after many windings and
      turnings&mdash;he got off and washed his spur, scrubbing it diligently
      with sand in an effort to remove the traces of fire. When the evidence was
      at least less conspicuous, he put it on his heel and jogged down the river
      bank quite innocently, inwardly thankful over his escape. He had certainly
      done nothing wrong; but one sometimes finds it rather awkward to be forced
      into an explanation of a perfectly righteous deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I'd been stealing that calf, I'd never have been crazy enough to take
      such a long chance,&rdquo; he mused, and laughed a little. &ldquo;I'll bet Fred
      thought he was due to grab a rustler right in the act&mdash;only he was a
      little bit slow about making up his mind; deputy stock inspectors had
      oughta think quicker than that&mdash;he was just about five minutes too
      deliberate. I'll gamble he's scratching his head, right now, over that
      blotched brand, trying to <i>sabe</i> the play&mdash;which he won't, not
      in a thousand years!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave the reins a twitch and began to climb through the dusk to the
      lighter hilltop, at a point just east of Cold Spring Coulee. At the top he
      put the spurs to his horse and headed straight as might be for the
      Wishbone ranch. He would like to have told Val of his success, but he was
      afraid Manley might be there, or Polycarp; it was wise always to avoid
      Polycarp Jenks, if one had anything to conceal from his fellows.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. VAL DECIDES
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was the middle of the next forenoon when Manley came riding home,
      sullen from drink and a losing game of poker, which had kept him all night
      at the table, and at sunrise sent him forth in the mood which meets a
      grievance more than half-way. He did not stop at the house, though he saw
      Val through the open door; he did not trouble to speak to her, even, but
      rode on to the stable, stopping at the corral to look over the fence at
      the calves, still bawling sporadically between half-hearted nibblings at
      the hay which Polycarp had thrown in to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at first he did not notice anything wrong, but soon a vague disquiet
      seized him, and he frowned thoughtfully at the little group. Something
      puzzled him; but his brain, fogged with whisky and loss of sleep, and the
      reaction from hours of concentration upon the game, could not quite grasp
      the thing that troubled him. In a moment, however, he gave an inarticulate
      bellow, wheeled about, and rode back to the house. He threw himself from
      the horse almost before it stopped, and rushed into the kitchen. Val,
      ironing one of her ruffled white aprons, looked up quickly, turned rather
      pale, and then stiffened perceptibly for the conflict that was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's only four calves in the corral&mdash;and I brought in five.
      Where's the other one?&rdquo; He came up and stood quite close to her&mdash;so
      close that Val took a step backward. He did not speak loud, but there was
      something in his tone, in his look, that drove the little remaining color
      from her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manley,&rdquo; she said, with a catch of the breath, &ldquo;why did you do that
      horrible thing? What devil possessed you? I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked you 'where is that other calf'? Where is it? There's only four. I
      brought in five.&rdquo; His very calmness was terrifying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val threw back her head, and her eyes were&mdash;as they frequently became
      in moments of stress&mdash;yellow, inscrutable, like the eyes of a lion in
      a cage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you brought in five. One of the five, at least, you&mdash;stole. You
      put your brand, Manley Fleetwood, on a calf that did not belong to you; it
      belonged to the Wishbone, and you know it. I have learned many
      disagreeable things about you, Manley, in the past two years; yesterday
      morning I learned that you were a <i>thief</i>. Ah-h&mdash;I despise you!
      Stealing from the very men who helped you&mdash;the men to whom you owe
      nothing but gratitude and&mdash;and friendship! Have you no manhood
      whatever? Besides being weak and shiftless, are you a criminal as well? <i>How</i>
      can you be so utterly lacking in&mdash;in common decency, even?&rdquo; She eyed
      him as she would look at some strange monster in a museum about which she
      was rather curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked you where that other calf is&mdash;and you'd better tell me!&rdquo; It
      was the tone which goes well with a knife thrust or a blow. But the
      contempt in Val's face did not change.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you'll have to hunt for it if you want it. The cow&mdash;a Wishbone
      cow, mind you!&mdash;came and claimed it; I let her have it. No stolen
      goods can remain on this ranch with my knowledge, Manley Fleetwood. Please
      remember&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you turned it out, did you? You turned it out?&rdquo; He had her by the
      throat, shaking her as a puppy shakes a purloined shoe. &ldquo;I could&mdash;<i>kill</i>
      you for that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manley! Ah-h-h&mdash;&rdquo; It was not pleasant&mdash;that gurgling cry, as
      she straggled to get free.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had the look of a maniac as he pressed his fingers into her throat and
      glared down into her purpling face.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sudden impulse he cast her limp form violently from him. She struck
      against a chair, fell from that to the floor, and lay a huddled heap, her
      crisp, ruffled skirt just giving a glimpse of tiny, half-worn slippers,
      her yellow hair fallen loose and hiding her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared down at her, but he felt no remorse&mdash;she had jeopardized
      his liberty, his standing among men. A cold horror caught him when he
      thought of the calf turned loose on the range, his brand on its ribs. He
      rushed in a panic from the kitchen, flung himself into the saddle, and
      went off across the coulee, whipping both sides of his horse. She had not
      told him&mdash;indeed, he had not asked her&mdash;which way the cow had
      gone, but instinctively he rode to the west, the direction from which he
      had driven the calves. One thought possessed him utterly; he must find
      that calf.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he rode here and there, doubling and turning to search every feeding
      herd he glimpsed, fearing to face the possibility of failure and its
      inevitable consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cat with the white spots on its sides&mdash;Val called her Mary
      Arabella, for some whimsical reason&mdash;came into the kitchen, looked
      inquiringly at the huddled figure upon the floor, gave a faint mew, and
      went slowly up, purring and arching her back; she snuffed a moment at
      Val's hair, then settled herself in the hollow of Val's arm, and curled
      down for a nap. The sun, sliding up to midday, shone straight in upon them
      through the open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polycarp Jenks, riding that way in obedience to some obscure impulse,
      lifted his hand to give his customary tap-tap before he walked in; saw Val
      lying there, and almost fell headlong into the room in his haste and
      perturbation. It looked very much as if he had at last stumbled upon the
      horrible tragedy which was his one daydream. To be an eyewitness of a
      murder, and to be able to tell the tale afterward with minute, horrifying
      detail&mdash;that, to Polycarp, would make life really worth living. He
      shuffled over to Val, pushed aside the mass of yellow hair, turned her
      head so that he could look into her face, saw at once the bruised marks
      upon her throat, and stood up very straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foul play has been done here!&rdquo; he exclaimed melodramatically, eying the
      cat sternly. &ldquo;Murder&mdash;that's what it is, by granny&mdash;a foul
      murder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The victim of the foul murder stirred slightly. Polycarp started and bent
      over her again, somewhat disconcerted, perhaps, but more humanly anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mis' Fleetwood&mdash;Mis' Fleetwood! You hurt? It's Polycarp Jenks
      talkin' to you!&rdquo; He hesitated, pushed the cat away, lifted Val with some
      difficulty, and carried her into the front room and deposited her on the
      couch. Then he hurried after some water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come might' nigh bein' a murder, by granny&mdash;from the marks on 'er
      neck&mdash;come might' nigh, all right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sprinkled water lavishly upon her face, bethought him of a possible
      whisky flask in the haystack, and ran every step of the way there and
      back. He found a discarded bottle with a very little left in it, and
      forced the liquor down her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That'll fetch ye if anything will&mdash;<i>he-he!</i>&rdquo; he mumbled,
      tittering from sheer excitement. Beyond a very natural desire to do what
      he could for her, he was extremely anxious to bring her to her senses, so
      that he could hear what had happened, and how it had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betche Man got jealous of her'n Kenneth&mdash;by granny, I betche that's
      how it come about&mdash;hey? Feelin' better, Mis' Fleetwood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val had opened her eyes and was looking at him rather stupidly. There was
      a bruise upon her head, as well as upon her throat. She had been stunned,
      and her wits came back slowly. When she recognized Polycarp, she tried
      ineffectually to sit up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;he&mdash;is&mdash;he&mdash;gone?&rdquo; Her voice was husky, her speech
      labored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man, you mean? He's gone, yes. Don't you be afeared&mdash;not whilst I'm
      here, by granny! How came it he done this to ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val was still staring at him bewilderedly. Polycarp repeated his question
      three times before the blank look left her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;turned the calf&mdash;out&mdash;the cow&mdash;came and&mdash;claimed
      it&mdash;Manley&mdash;&rdquo; She lifted her hand as if it were very, very
      heavy, and fumbled at her throat. &ldquo;Manley&mdash;when I told him&mdash;he
      was a&mdash;thief&mdash;&rdquo; She dropped her hand wearily to her side and
      closed her eyes, as if the sight of Polycarp's face, so close to hers and
      so insatiably curious and eager and cunning, was more than she could bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; she commanded, after a minute or two. &ldquo;I'm&mdash;all right.
      It's nothing. I fell. It was&mdash;the heat. Thank you&mdash;so much&mdash;&rdquo;
       She opened her eyes and saw him there still. She looked at him gravely,
      speculatively. She waved her hand toward the bedroom. &ldquo;Get me my hand
      glass&mdash;in there on the dresser,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had tiptoed in and got it for her, she lifted it up slowly, with
      both hands, until she could see her throat. There were distinct, telltale
      marks upon the tender flesh&mdash;unmistakable finger prints. She shivered
      and dropped the glass to the floor. But she stared steadily up at
      Polycarp, and after a moment she spoke with a certain fierceness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Polycarp Jenks, don't ever tell&mdash;about those marks. I&mdash;I don't
      want any one to know. When&mdash;after a while&mdash;I want to think first&mdash;perhaps
      you can help me. Go away now&mdash;not away from the ranch, but&mdash;let
      me think. I'm all right&mdash;or I will be. Please go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Polycarp recognized that tone, however it might be hoarsened by bruised
      muscles and the shock of what she had suffered. He recognized also that
      look in her eyes; he had always obeyed that look and that tone&mdash;he
      obeyed them now, though with visible reluctance. He sat down in the
      kitchen to wait, and while he waited he chewed tobacco incessantly, and
      ruminated upon the mystery which lay behind the few words Val had first
      spoken, before she realized just what it was she was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long, long while&mdash;so long that even Polycarp's patience was
      feeling the strain&mdash;Val opened the door and stood leaning weakly
      against the casing. Her throat was swathed in a piece of white silk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish, Polycarp, you'd get the team and hitch it to the light rig,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;I want to go to town, and I don't feel able to drive. Can you take
      me in? Can you spare the time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, certainly, I c'n take you in, Mis' Fleetwood. I was jest thinkn' it
      wa'n't safe for you out here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is perfectly safe,&rdquo; Val interrupted chillingly. &ldquo;I am going because I
      Want to see Arline Hawley.&rdquo; She raised her hand to the bandage. &ldquo;I have a
      sore throat,&rdquo; she stated, staring hard at him. Then, with one of her
      impulsive changes, she smiled wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be my friend, Polycarp, won't you?&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;I can trust you,
      I know, with my&mdash;secret. It is a secret&mdash;it <i>must</i> be a
      secret! I'll tell you the truth, Polycarp. It was Manley&mdash;he had been
      drinking again. He&mdash;we had a quarrel&mdash;about something. He didn't
      know what he was doing&mdash;he didn't mean to hurt me. But I fell&mdash;I
      struck my head; see, there is a great lump there.&rdquo; She pushed back her
      hair to show him the place. &ldquo;So it's a secret&mdash;just between you and
      me, Polycarp Jenks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, certainly, Mis' Fleetwood; don't you be the least mite oneasy; I'm
      your friend&mdash;I always have been. A feller ain't to be held
      responsible when he's drinkin'&mdash;by granny, that's a fact, he ain't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Val agreed laconically, &ldquo;I suppose not. Let us go, then, as soon as
      we can, please. I'll stay overnight with Mrs. Hawley, and you can bring me
      back to-morrow, can't you? And you'll remember not to mention&mdash;anything,
      won't you, Polycarp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Polycarp stood very straight and dignified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, Mis' Fleetwood, you can always depend on Polycarp Jenks,&rdquo; he
      replied virtuously. &ldquo;Your secret is safe with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val smiled&mdash;somewhat doubtfully, it is true&mdash;and let him go.
      &ldquo;Maybe it is&mdash;I hope so,&rdquo; she sighed, as she turned away to dress for
      the trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      All through that long ride to town, Polycarp talked and talked and talked.
      He made surmises and waited openly to hear them confirmed or denied; he
      gave her advice; he told her everything he had ever heard about Manley, or
      had seen or knew from some other source; everything, that is, save what
      was good. The sums he had lost at poker, or had borrowed; the debts he
      owed to the merchants; the reputation he had for &ldquo;talking big and doing
      little;&rdquo; the trouble he had had with this man and that man; and what he
      did not know for a certainty he guessed at, and so kept the subject alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, Val did not speak at all, except when he asked her how she felt.
      Then she would reply dully, &ldquo;Pretty well, thank you, Polycarp.&rdquo; Invariably
      those were the words she used. Whenever he stole a furtive, sidelong
      glance at her, she was staring straight ahead at the great, undulating
      prairie with the brown ribbon, which was the trail, thrown carelessly
      across to the sky line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polycarp suspected that she did not see anything&mdash;she just stared
      with her eyes, while her thoughts were somewhere else. He was not even
      sure that she heard what he was saying. He thought she must be pretty
      sick, she was so pale, and she had such wide, purple rings under her eyes.
      Also, he rather resented her desire to keep her trouble a secret; he
      favored telling everybody, and organizing a party to go out and run Man
      Fleetwood out of the country, as the very mildest rebuke which the
      outraged community could give and remain self-respecting. He even fell
      silent daring the last three or four miles, while he dwelt longingly upon
      the keen pleasure there would be in leading such an expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll remember, Polycarp, not to speak of this?&rdquo; Val urged abruptly when
      he drew up before the Hawley Hotel. &ldquo;Not a hint, you know until&mdash;until
      I give you permission. You promised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly, Mis' Fleetwood. Certainly. Don't you be a mite oneasy.&rdquo;
       But the tone of Polycarp was dejected in the extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And please be ready to drive me back in the morning. I should like to be
      at the ranch by noon, at the latest.&rdquo; With that she left him and went into
      the hotel.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. A FRIEND IN NEED
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; Val finished, rather apathetically, pushing back the fallen lock
      of hair, &ldquo;it has come to that. I can't remain here and keep any shred of
      self-respect. All my life I've been taught to believe divorce a terrible
      thing&mdash;a crime, almost; now I think it is sometimes a crime <i>not</i>
      to be divorced. For months I have been coming slowly to a decision, so
      this is really not as sudden as it may seem to you. It is humiliating to
      be compelled to borrow money&mdash;but I would much rather ask you than
      any of my own people. My pride is going to suffer enough when I meet them,
      as it is; I can't let them know just how miserable and sordid a failure&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arline gave an inarticulate snort, bent her scrawny body nearly double,
      and reached frankly into her stocking. She fumbled there a moment and
      straightened triumphantly, grasping a flat, buckskin bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd feel like shakin' you if you went to anybody else but me,&rdquo; she
      declared, untying the bag. &ldquo;I know what men is&mdash;Lord knows I see
      enough of 'em and their meanness&mdash;and if I can help a woman outa the
      clutches of one, I'm tickled to death to git the chancet. I ain't sayin'
      they're all of 'em bad&mdash;I c'n afford to give the devil his due and
      still say that men is the limit. The good ones is so durn scarce it ain't
      one woman in fifty lucky enough to git one. All I blame you for is stayin'
      with him as long as you have. I'd of quit long ago; I was beginnin' to
      think you never would come to your senses. But you had to fight that thing
      out for yourself; every woman has to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you've woke up to the fact that Man Fleetwood didn't git a deed
      to you, body and soul, when he married you; you've been actin' as if you
      thought he had. And I'm glad you've got sense enough to pull outa the game
      when you know the best you can expect is the worst of it. There ain't no
      hope for Man Fleetwood; I seen that when he went back to drinkin' again
      after you was burnt out. I did think that would steady him down, but he
      ain't the kind that braces up when trouble hits him&mdash;he's the sort
      that stays down ruther than go to the trouble of gittin' up. He's hopeless
      now as a rotten egg, and has been for the last year. Here; you take the
      hull works, and if you need more, I can easy git it for you by sendin' in
      to the bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but this is too much!&rdquo; Val protested when she had counted the money.
      &ldquo;You're so good&mdash;but really and truly, I won't need half&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arline pushed away the proffered money impatiently. &ldquo;How'n time are you
      goin' to tell how much you'll need? Lemme tell you, Val Peyson&mdash;I
      ain't goin' to call you by his name no more, the dirty cur!&mdash;I've
      been packin' that money in my stockin' for six months, jest so'st to have
      it handy when you wanted it. Divorces cost more'n marriage licenses, as
      you'll find out when you git started. And&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;why, the idea!&rdquo; Val pursed her lips with something like her old
      spirit. &ldquo;How could <i>you</i> know I'd need to borrow money? I didn't know
      it myself, even. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I c'n see through a wall when there's a knothole in it,&rdquo;
       paraphrased Arline calmly. &ldquo;You may not know it, but you've been gittin'
      your back-East notions knocked outa you pretty fast the last year or so.
      It was all a question of what kinda stuff you was made of underneath. You
      c'n put a polish on most anything, so I couldn't tell, right at first,
      what there was to you. But you're all right&mdash;I've seen that a long
      time back; and so I knowed durn well you'd be wantin' money to pull loose
      with. It takes money, though I know it ain't polite to say much about real
      dollars 'n' cents. You'll likely use every cent of that before you're
      through with the deal&mdash;and remember, there's a lot more growin' on
      the same bush, if you need it. It's only waitin' to be picked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val stared, found her eyes blurring so that she could not see, and with a
      sudden, impulsive movement leaned over and put her arms around Arline,
      unkempt, scrawny, and wholly unlovely though she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arline, you're an angel of goodness!&rdquo; she cried brokenly. &ldquo;You're the
      best friend I ever had in my life&mdash;I've had many who petted me and
      flattered me&mdash;but you&mdash;you <i>do</i> things! I'm ashamed&mdash;because
      I haven't loved you every minute since I first saw you. I judged you&mdash;I
      mean&mdash;oh, you're pure, shining gold inside, instead of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, git out!&rdquo; Arline was compelled to gulp twice before she could say
      even that much. &ldquo;I don't shine nowhere&mdash;inside er out. I know that
      well enough. I never had no chancet to shine. It's always been wore off
      with hard knocks. But I like shiny folks all right&mdash;when they're fine
      clear through, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arline&mdash;dear, I do love you. I always shall. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arline loosened her clasp and jumped up precipitately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Git out!&rdquo; she repeated bashfully. &ldquo;If you git me to cryin', Val Peyson,
      I'll wish you was in Halifax. You go to bed, 'n' go to sleep, er I'll&mdash;&rdquo;
       She almost ran from the room. Outside, she stopped in a darkened corner of
      the hallway and stood for some minutes with her checked gingham apron
      pressed tightly over her face, and several times she sniffed audibly. When
      she finally returned to the kitchen her nose was pink, her eyelids were
      pink, and she was extremely petulant when she caught Minnie eying her
      curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val had refused to eat any supper, and, beyond telling Arline that she had
      decided to leave Manley and return to her mother in Fern Hill, she had not
      explained anything very clearly&mdash;her colorless face, for instance,
      nor her tightly swathed throat, nor the very noticeable bruise upon her
      temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arline had not asked a single question. Now, however, she spent some time
      fixing a tray with the daintiest food she knew and could procure, and took
      it upstairs with a certain diffidence in her manner and a rare tenderness
      in her faded, worldly-wise eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got to eat, you know,&rdquo; she reminded Val gently. &ldquo;You're bucking up
      ag'inst the hardest part of the trail, and grub's a necessity. Take it
      like you would medicine&mdash;unless your throat's too sore. I see you got
      it all tied up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val raised her hands in a swift alarm and clasped her throat as if she
      feared Arline would remove the bandages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's not sore&mdash;that is, it is sore&mdash;I mean not very much,&rdquo;
       she stammered betrayingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arline set down the tray upon the dresser and faced Val grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never asked you any questions, did I?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;But you act for
      all the world as if&mdash;do you want me to give a guess about that
      tied-up neck, and that black'n'blue lump on your forehead? I never asked
      any questions&mdash;I didn't need to. Man Fleetwood's been maulin' you
      abound. I was kinda afraid he'd git to that point some day when he got mad
      enough; he's just the brand to beat up a woman. But if it took a beatin'
      to bring you to the quitting point, I'm glad he done it. <i>Only</i>,&rdquo; she
      added darkly, &ldquo;he better keep outa my reach; I'm jest in the humor to claw
      him up some if I should git close enough. And if I happened to forget I'm
      a lady, I'd sure bawl him out, and the bigger crowd heard me the better.
      Now, you eat this&mdash;and don't get the idee you can cover up any
      meanness of Man Fleetwood's; not from me, anyhow. I know men better'n you
      do; you couldn't tell me nothing about 'em that would su'prise me the
      least bit. I'm only thankful he didn't murder you in cold blood. Are you
      going to eat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if you keep on reminding me of such h-horrid things,&rdquo; wailed Val, and
      sobbed into her pillow. &ldquo;It's bad enough to&mdash;to have him ch-choke me
      without having you t-talk about it all the time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, honey, don't you waste no tears on a brute like him&mdash;he ain't
      w-worth it!&rdquo; Arline was on her bony knees beside the bed, crying with
      sympathy and self-reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, in truly feminine fashion, the two wept their way back to the solid
      ground of everyday living. Before they reached that desirable state of
      composure, however, Val told her everything&mdash;within certain limits
      set not by caution, but rather by her woman's instinct. She did not, for
      instance, say much about Kent, though she regretted openly that Polycarp
      knew so much about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope never needed no newspaper so long as Polycarp lives here,&rdquo; Arline
      grumbled when Val was sitting up again and trying to eat Arline's toast,
      and jelly made of buffalo berries, and sipping the tea which had gone
      cold. &ldquo;But if I can round him up in time, I'll try and git him to keep his
      mouth shet. I'll scare the liver outa him some way. But if he caught onto
      that calf deal&mdash;&rdquo; She shook her head doubtfully. &ldquo;The worst of it is,
      Fred's in town, and he's always pumpin' Polycarp dry, jest to find out all
      that's goin' on. You go to bed, and I'll see if I can find out whether
      they're together. If they are&mdash;but you needn't to worry none. I
      reckon I'm a match for the both of 'em. Why, I'd dope their coffee and
      send 'em both to sleep till Man got outa the country, if I had to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood with her hands upon her angular hips and glared at Val.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sure would do that, very thing&mdash;for <i>you</i>,&rdquo; she reiterated
      solemnly, &ldquo;I don't purtend I'd do it for Man&mdash;but I would for you.
      But it's likely Kent has fixed things up so they can't git nothing on Man
      if they try. He would if he said he would; that there's <i>one</i> feller
      that's on the square. You go to bed now, whilst I go on a still hunt of my
      own. I'll come and tell you if there's anything to tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was easy enough to make the promise, but keeping it was so difficult
      that she yielded to the temptation of going to bed and letting Val sleep
      in peace; which she could not have done if she had known that Polycarp
      Jenks and Fred De Garmo left town on horseback within an hour after
      Polycarp had entered it, and that they told no man their errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over behind Brinberg's store, Polycarp had told Fred all he knew, all he
      suspected, and all he believed would come to pass. &ldquo;Strictly on the
      quiet,&rdquo; of course&mdash;he reminded Fred of that, over and over, because
      he had promised Mrs. Fleetwood that he would not mention it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, by granny,&rdquo; he apologized, &ldquo;I didn't like the idee of keepin' <i>a</i>
      thing like that from <i>you</i>; it would kinda look as if I was standin'
      in on the deal, which I ain't. Nobody can't accuse me of rustlin', no
      matter what else I might do; you know that, Fred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, I know you're honest, anyway,&rdquo; Fred responded quite sincerely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I considered it my duty to tell you. I've kinda had my suspicions
      all fall, that there was somethin' scaly goin' on at Cold Spring. Looked
      to me like Man had too blamed many calves missed by spring round-up&mdash;for
      the size of his herd. I dunno, of course, jest where he gits 'em&mdash;you'll
      have to find that out. But he's brung twelve er fourteen to the ranch, two
      er three at a time. And what she said when she first come to&mdash;told me
      right out, by granny, 'at Man choked her because she called 'im a thief,
      and somethin' about a cow comin' an' claimin' her calf, and her turnin' it
      out. That oughta be might' nigh all the evidence you need, Fred, if you
      find it. She don't know she said it, but she wouldn't of told it, by
      granny, if it wasn't so&mdash;now would she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you say all this happened to-day?&rdquo; Fred pondered for a minute.
      &ldquo;That's queer, because I almost caught a fellow last night doing some
      funny work on a calf. A Wishbone cow it was, and her calf fresh burned&mdash;a
      barred-out brand, by thunder! If it was to-day, I'd, say Man found it and
      blotched the brand. I wish now I'd hazed them over to the Double Diamond
      and corralled 'em, like I had a mind to. But we can find them, easy
      enough. But that was last night, and you say this big setting came off
      to-day; you <i>sure</i>, Polly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Course I'm sure.&rdquo; Polycarp waggled his head solemnly. He was enjoying
      himself to the limit. He was the man on the inside, giving out information
      of the greatest importance, and an officer of the law was hanging
      anxiously upon his words. He spoke slowly, giving weight to every word. &ldquo;I
      rode up to the house&mdash;Man's house&mdash;somewhere close to noon, an'
      there she was, layin' on the kitchen floor. Didn't know nothin', an' had
      the marks of somebody's fingers on 'er throat; the rest of her neck's so
      white they showed up, by granny, like&mdash;like&mdash;&rdquo; Polycarp never
      could think of a simile. He always expectorated in such an emergency, and
      left his sentence unfinished. He did so now, and Fred cut in unfeelingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind that&mdash;you've gone over it half a dozen times. You say it
      was to-day, at noon, or thereabouts. Man must have done it when he found
      out she'd turned the calf loose&mdash;he wouldn't unless he was pretty
      mad, and scared. He isn't cold-blooded enough to wait till he'd barred out
      the brand, and then go home and choke his wife. He didn't know about the
      calf till to-day, that's a cinch.&rdquo; He studied the matter with an air of
      grave importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Polycarp,&rdquo; he said abruptly, &ldquo;I'm going to need you. We've got to find
      that bunch of cattle&mdash;it ought to be easy enough, and haze 'em down
      into Man's field where his bunch of calves are&mdash;see? Any calf that's
      been weaned in the last three weeks will be pretty likely to claim its
      mother; and if he's got any calves branded that claim cows with some other
      brand&mdash;well&mdash;&rdquo; He threw out his hands in a comprehensive
      gesture. &ldquo;That's the quickest way I know to get him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want a
      witness along, and some help. And you,&rdquo; he eyed Polycarp keenly, &ldquo;ain't
      safe running around town loose. All your brains seem to leak out your
      mouth. So you come along with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;any time after to-morrer,&rdquo; hedged Polycarp, offended by the
      implication that he talked too much. &ldquo;I've got to drive the team home for
      Mis' Fleetwood to-morrer, I tol' her I would&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you won't. You're going to hit the trail with me just as soon as I
      can find a horse for you to ride. We'll sleep at the Double Diamond, and
      start from there in the morning. And if I catch you letting a word outa
      you about this deal, I'll just about have to arrest you for&mdash;&rdquo; He did
      not quite know what, but the very vagueness of the threat had its effect
      upon Polycarp.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went without further argument, though first he went to the Hawley Hotel&mdash;with
      Fred close beside him as a precaution against imprudent gossip&mdash;and
      left word in the office that he would not be able to drive Mrs. Fleetwood
      home, the next morning, but would be back to take her out the day after
      that, if she did not mind staying in town. It was that message which
      Arline deliberately held back from Val until morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You better stay here,&rdquo; she advised then. &ldquo;Polycarp an' Fred's up to some
      devilment, that's a cinch; but whatever it is, you're better off right
      here with me. S'posen you should drive out there and run into Man&mdash;what
      then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val shivered. &ldquo;I&mdash;that's the only thing I can't bear,&rdquo; she admitted,
      as if the time for proud dignity and reserve had gone by. &ldquo;If I could be
      sure I wouldn't need to meet him, I'd rather go alone; really and truly, I
      would. You know the horses are perfectly safe&mdash;I've driven them to
      town fifty times if I have once. I had to, out there alone so much of the
      time. I'd rather not have Polycarp spying around. I've got to pack up&mdash;there
      are so many things of no value to&mdash;to <i>him</i>, things I brought
      out here with me. And there are all my manuscripts; I can't leave them
      lying around, even if they aren't worth anything; especially since they
      aren't worth anything.&rdquo; She pushed back her hair with a weary movement.
      &ldquo;If I could only be sure&mdash;if I knew where <i>he</i> is,&rdquo; she sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll lend you my gun,&rdquo; Arline offered in good faith. &ldquo;If he comes around
      you and starts any funny business again, you can stand him off, even if
      you got some delicate feelin's about blowin' his brains out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I couldn't. I'm deadly afraid of guns.&rdquo; Val shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then you can't go atone. I'd go with you, if you could git packed
      up so as to come back to-day. I guess Min could make out to git two meals
      alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. Really and truly, Arline, I'd just as soon go alone. I would
      rather, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arline was not accustomed to being called &ldquo;dear.&rdquo; She surrendered with
      some confusion and a blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you better wait,&rdquo; she admonished temporizingly. &ldquo;Something may turn
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently something did turn up. She rushed breathlessly into Val's room
      and caught her by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now's your chancet, Val,&rdquo; she hissed in a loud whisper. &ldquo;Man jest now
      rode into town; he's over in Pop's place&mdash;I seen him go in. He's good
      for the day, sure. I'll have Hank hitch right up, an' you can go down to
      the stable and start from there, so'st he won't see you. An' I'll keep an
      eye out, 'n' if he leaves town I won't be fur behind, lemme tell you. He
      won't, though; there ain't one chancet in a hundred he'll leave that
      saloon till he's full&mdash;an' if he tries t' go then, I'll have somebody
      lock 'im up in the ice house till you git back. You want to hurry up that
      packin', an' git in here quick's you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went to the stable with Val, her apron thrown over her head for want
      of a hat. &ldquo;When Val was settling herself in the seat, Arline caught at the
      wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say! How'n time you goin' to git your trunks loaded into the wagon?&rdquo; she
      cried. &ldquo;You can't do it alone.&rdquo; Val parsed her lips; she had not thought
      of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Polycarp will come, by the time I am ready,&rdquo; she decided. &ldquo;You
      couldn't keep him away, Arline; he would be afraid he might miss
      something, because I suppose ours is the only ranch in the country where
      the wheels aren't turning smoothly. Polycarp and I can manage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hank, grinning under his ragged, brown mustache, handed her the lines.
      &ldquo;I've got my orders,&rdquo; he told her briefly. &ldquo;I'll watch out the trail's
      kept clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you. I've so many good friends,&rdquo; Val answered, giving him a
      smile to stir his sluggish blood. &ldquo;Good-bye, Arline. Don't worry about me,
      there's a dear. I shall not be back before to-morrow night, probably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both Arline and Hank stood where they were and watched her out of sight
      before they turned back to the sordid tasks which made up their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll make it&mdash;she's the proper stuff,&rdquo; Hank remarked, and lighted
      his pipe. Arline, for a wonder, sighed and said nothing.

      CHAPTER XXIII. CAUGHT!
    </h2>
    <p>
      After two nights and a day of torment unbearable, Kent bolted from his
      work, which would have taken him that day, as it had done the day before,
      in a direction opposite to that which his mind and his heart followed, and
      without apology or explanation to his foreman rode straight to Cold Spring
      Coulee. He had no very definite plan, except to see Val. He did not even
      know what he would say when he faced her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael was steaming from nose to tail when he stopped at the yard gate,
      which shows how impatience had driven his master. Kent glanced quickly
      around the place as he walked up the narrow path to the house. Nothing was
      changed in the slightest particular, as far as he could see, and he
      realized then that he had been uneasy as well as anxious. Both doors were
      closed, so that he was obliged to knock before Val became visible. He had
      a fleeting impression of extreme caution in the way she opened the door
      and looked out, but he forgot it immediately in his joy at seeing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's you. Come in, and&mdash;you won't mind if I close the door? I'm
      afraid I'm the victim of nerves, to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Kent was instantly solicitous. &ldquo;Has anything happened since I was
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val shook her head, smiling faintly. &ldquo;Nothing that need to worry <i>you</i>,
      pal. I don't want to talk about worries. I want to be cheered up; I
      haven't laughed, Kent, for so long I'm afraid my facial muscles are
      getting stiff. Say something funny, can't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent pushed his hat far back on his head and sat down upon a corner of the
      table. &ldquo;Such is life in the far West&mdash;and the farther West you go,
      the livelier&mdash;&rdquo; he began to declaim dutifully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The livelier it gets. Yes, I've heard that a million tunes, I believe. I
      can't laugh at that; I never did think it funny.&rdquo; She sighed, and twitched
      her shoulders impatiently because of it. &ldquo;I see you brought back the
      glasses,&rdquo; she remarked inanely. &ldquo;You certainly weren't in any great hurry,
      were you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they had us riding over east of the home ranch, hazing in some outa
      the hills. I'm supposed to be over there right now&mdash;but I ain't. I
      expect I'll get the can, all right&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you're going away, what do you care?&rdquo; she taunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm&mdash;sure, what do I care?&rdquo; He eyed her from under his brows while
      he bent to light a match upon the sole of his boot. Val had long ago
      settled his compunctions about smoking in her presence. &ldquo;You seem to be
      all tore up, here,&rdquo; he observed irrelevantly. &ldquo;Cleaning house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;cleaning house.&rdquo; Val smiled ambiguously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hubby in town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;he went in yesterday, and hasn't come back yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent smoked for a moment meditatively. &ldquo;I found that calf, all right,&rdquo; he
      informed her at last. &ldquo;It was too late to ride around this way and tell
      you that night. So you needn't worry any more about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not worrying about that.&rdquo; Val stooped and picked up a hairpin from
      the floor, and twirled it absently in her fingers. &ldquo;I don't think it
      matters, any more. Yesterday afternoon Fred De Garmo and Polycarp Jenks
      came into the coulee with a bunch of cattle, and turned all the calves out
      of the river field with them; and, after a little, they drove the whole
      lot of them away somewhere&mdash;over that way.&rdquo; She waved a slim hand to
      the west. &ldquo;They let out the calves in the corral, too. I saw them from the
      window, but I didn't ask them any questions. I really didn't need to, did
      I?&rdquo; She grazed him with a glance. &ldquo;I thought perhaps you had failed to
      find that calf; I'm glad you did, though&mdash;so it wasn't that started
      them hunting around here&mdash;Polycarp and Fred I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent looked at her queerly. Her voice was without any emotion whatever, as
      if the subject held no personal interest for her. He finished his
      cigarette and threw the stub out into the yard before either of them spoke
      another word. He closed the door again, stood there for a minute making up
      his mind, and went slowly over to where she was sitting listlessly in a
      chair, her hands folded loosely in her lap. He gripped with one hand the
      chairback and stared down at her high-piled, yellow hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long do you think I'm going to stand around and let you be dragged
      into trouble like this?&rdquo; he began abruptly. &ldquo;You know what I told you the
      other day&mdash;I could say the same thing over again, and a lot more; and
      I'd mean more than I could find words for. Maybe you can stand this sort
      of thing&mdash;I can't. I'm not going to try. If you're bound to stick to
      that&mdash;that gentleman, I'm going to get outa the country where I can't
      see you killed by inches. Every time I come, you're a little bit whiter,
      and a little bigger-eyed&mdash;I can't stand it, I tell you!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You weren't made for a hell like you're living. You were meant to be
      happy&mdash;and I was meant to make you happy. Every morning when I open
      my eyes&mdash;do you know what I think? I think it's another day we oughta
      be happy in, you and me.&rdquo; He took her suddenly by the shoulder and brought
      her up, facing him, where he could look into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've only got just one life to live, Val!&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;And we could be
      happy together&mdash;I'd stake my life on that. I can't go on forever just
      being friends, and eating my heart out for you, and seeing you abused&mdash;and
      what for? Just because a preacher mumbled some words over you two! Only
      for that, you wouldn't stay with him over-night, and you know it! Is <i>that</i>
      what ought to tie two human beings together&mdash;without love, or even
      friendship? You hate him; you can't look me in the eyes and say you don't.
      And he's tired of you. Some other woman would please him better. And I
      could make you happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val broke away from his grasp, and retreated until the table was between
      them. Her listlessness was a thing forgotten. She was panting with the
      quick beating of her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kent&mdash;don't, pal! You mustn't say those things&mdash;it's wicked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's true,&rdquo; he cried hotly. &ldquo;Can you look at me and say it ain't the
      truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've spoiled our friendship, Kent!&rdquo; she accused, while she evaded his
      question. &ldquo;It meant so much to me&mdash;just your dear, good friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My love could mean a whole lot more,&rdquo; he declared sturdily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you mustn't say those things&mdash;you mustn't feel that way, Kent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; He laughed grimly. &ldquo;Mustn't I? How are you going to stop me?&rdquo; He
      stared hard at her, his face growing slowly rigid. &ldquo;There's just one way
      to stop me from saying such wicked things,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;You can tell me
      you don't care anything about me, and never could, not even if that
      down-east conscience of yours didn't butt into the game. You can tell me
      that, and swear it's the truth, and I'll leave the country. I'll go so far
      you'll newer see me again, so I'll never bother you any more. I can't
      promise I'll stop loving you&mdash;but for my own sake I'll sure try hard
      enough.&rdquo; He set his teeth hard together and stood quiet, watching her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val tied to answer him. Evidently she could not manage her voice, for he
      saw her begin softly beating her lips with her fist, fighting to get back
      her self-control. Once or twice he had seen her do that, when, womanlike,
      the tears would come in spite of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want you to go a-away,&rdquo; she articulated at last, with a hint of
      stubbornness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what <i>do</i> you want? I can't stay, unless&mdash;&rdquo; He did not
      attempt to finish the sentence. He knew there was no need; she understood
      well enough the alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
      For long minutes she did not speak, because she could not. Like many
      women, she fought desperately against the tears which seemed a badge of
      her femininity. She sat down in a chair, dropped her face upon her folded
      arms, and bit her lips until they were sore. Kent took a step toward her,
      reconsidered, and went over to the window, where he stood staring moodily
      out until she began speaking. Even then, he did not turn immediately
      toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't go, Kent,&rdquo; she said with some semblance of calm. &ldquo;Because I'm
      going. I didn't tell you&mdash;but I'm going home. I'm going to get free,
      by the same law that tied me to him. You are right&mdash;I have a
      'down-east' conscience. I think I was born with it. It demands that I get
      my freedom honestly; I can't steal it&mdash;pal. I couldn't be happy if I
      did that, no matter how hard I might try&mdash;or you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned eagerly toward her then, but she stopped him with a gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;stay where you are. I want to solve my problem and&mdash;and
      leave you out of it; you're a complication, pal&mdash;when you talk like&mdash;like
      you've just been talking. It makes my conscience wonder whether I'm honest
      with myself. I've got to leave you out, don't you see? And so, leaving you
      out, I don't feel that any woman should be expected to go on like I'm
      doing. You don't know&mdash;I couldn't tell you just how&mdash;impossible&mdash;this
      marriage of mine has become. The day after&mdash;well, yesterday&mdash;no,
      the day before yesterday&mdash;he came home and found out&mdash;what I'd
      done. He&mdash;I couldn't stay here, after that, so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he do?&rdquo; Kent demanded sharply. &ldquo;He didn't dare to lay his hands
      on you&mdash;did he? By&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't swear, Kent&mdash;I hear so much of that from him!&rdquo; Val smiled
      curiously. &ldquo;He&mdash;he swore at me. I couldn't stay with him, after that&mdash;could
      I, dear?&rdquo; Whether she really meant to speak that last word or not, it set
      Kent's blood dancing so that he forgot to urge his question farther. He
      took two eager steps toward her, and she retreated again behind the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kent, don't! How can I tell you anything, if you won't be good?&rdquo; She
      waited until he was standing rather sulkily by the window again. &ldquo;Anyway,
      it doesn't matter now what he has done. I am going to leave him. I'm going
      to get a divorce. Not even the strictest 'down-east' conscience could
      demand that I stay. I'm perfectly at ease upon that point. About this last
      trouble&mdash;with the calves&mdash;if I could help him, I would, of
      course. But all I could say would only make matters worse&mdash;and I'm a
      wretched failure at lying. I can help him more, I think, by going away. I
      feel certain there's going to be trouble over those calves. Fred De Garmo
      never would have come down here and driven them all away, would he, unless
      there was going to be trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he came in here and got the calves, it looks as if he meant business,
      all right.&rdquo; Kent frowned absently at the white window curtain. &ldquo;I've seen
      the time,&rdquo; he added reflectively, &ldquo;when I'd be all broke up to have Man
      get into trouble. We used to be pretty good friends!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A year ago it would have broken my heart,&rdquo; Val sighed. &ldquo;We do change so!
      I can't quite understand Why I should feel so indifferent about it now;
      even the other day it was terrible. But when I felt his fingers&mdash;&rdquo;
       she stopped guiltily. &ldquo;He seems a stranger to me now. I don't even hate
      him so very much. I don't want to meet him, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither do I.&rdquo; But there was a different meaning in Kent's tone. &ldquo;So
      you're going to quit?&rdquo; He looked at her thoughtfully&mdash;&ldquo;You'll leave
      your address, I hope!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo; Val's voice betrayed some inward trepidation. &ldquo;I'm not running
      away; I'm just going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see.&rdquo; He sighed, impatient at the restraint she had put upon him. &ldquo;That
      don't mean you won't ever come back, does it? Or that the trains are going
      to quit carrying passengers to your town? Because you can't <i>always</i>
      keep me outa your 'problem,' let me tell you. Is it against the rules to
      ask when you're going&mdash;and how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as soon as I can get my trunks packed, and Polycarp&mdash;or
      somebody&mdash;comes to help me load them into the spring wagon. I
      promised Arline Hawley I would be in town to-night. I don't know, though&mdash;I
      don't seem to be making much progress with my packing.&rdquo; She smiled at him
      more brightly. &ldquo;Let's wade ashore, pal, and get to work instead of talking
      about things better left alone. I know just exactly what you're thinking&mdash;and
      I'm going to let you help me instead of Polycarp. I'm frightfully angry
      with him, anyway. He promised me, on his word of honor, that he wouldn't
      mention a thing&mdash;and he must have actually hunted for a chance to
      tell! He didn't have the nerve to come to the house yesterday, when he was
      here with Fred&mdash;perhaps he won't come to-day, after all. So you'll
      have to help me make my getaway, pal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent wavered. &ldquo;You're the limit, all right,&rdquo; he told her after a period of
      hesitation. &ldquo;You just wait, old girl, till you get that conscience of
      yours squared! What shall I do? I can pack a war-bag in one minute and
      three-quarters, and a horse in five minutes&mdash;provided he don't get
      gay and pitch the pack off a time or two, and somebody's around to help
      throw the hitch. Just tell me where to start in, and you won't be able to
      see me for dust!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem in a frightful hurry to have me go,&rdquo; Val complained, laughing
      nevertheless with the nervous reaction. &ldquo;Packing a trunk takes time, and
      care, and intelligence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now isn't that awful?&rdquo; Kent's eyes flared with mirth, all the more
      pronounced because it was entirely superficial. &ldquo;Well, you take the time
      and care, Mrs. Goodpacker, and I'll cheerfully furnish the intelligence,
      This goes, I reckon?&rdquo; He squeezed a pink cushion into as small a space as
      possible, and held it out at arm's length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That goes&mdash;to Arline. <i>Don't</i> put it in there!&rdquo; Val's laughter
      was not far from hysteria. Kent was pretending to stuff the pink cushion
      into her hand bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better take it; you'll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The front door was pushed violently open and Manley almost fell into the
      room. Val gave a little, inarticulate cry and shrank back against the wall
      before she could recover herself. They had for the moment forgotten
      Manley, and all he stood for in the way of heartbreak.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange-looking Manley he was, with his white face and staring,
      bloodshot eyes, and the cruel, animal lines around his mouth. Hardly
      recognizable to one who had not seen him since three or four years before,
      he would have been. He stopped short just over the threshold, and glanced
      suspiciously from one to the other before he came farther into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dig up some grub, Val&mdash;in a bag, so I can carry it on horseback,&rdquo; he
      commanded. &ldquo;And a blanket&mdash;where did you put those rifle cartridges?&rdquo;
       He hurried across the room to where his rifle and belt hung upon the wall,
      just over the little, homemade bookcase. &ldquo;I had a couple of boxes&mdash;where
      are they?&rdquo; He snatched down the rifle, took the belt, and began buckling
      it around him with fumbling fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mechanically Val reached upon a higher shelf and got him the two boxes of
      shells. Her eyes were fixed curiously upon his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; she asked him as he tore open a box and began pushing
      the shells, one by one, into his belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fred De Garmo&mdash;he tried to arrest me&mdash;in town&mdash;I shot him
      dead,&rdquo; He glanced furtively at Kent. &ldquo;Can I take your horse, Kent? I want
      to get across the river before&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shot&mdash;Fred&mdash;&rdquo; Val was staring at him stupidly. He whirled
      savagely toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I'd shoot any man that walked up and tried to take me. He was a
      fool if he thought all he had to do was crook his finger and say 'Come
      along.' It was over those calves&mdash;and I'd say you had a hand in it,
      if I hadn't found that calf, and saw how you burned out the brand before
      you turned it loose. You might have told me&mdash;I wouldn't have&mdash;&rdquo;
       He shifted his gaze toward Kent. &ldquo;The hell of it is, the sheriff happened
      to be in town for something; he's back a couple of miles&mdash;for God's
      sake, move! And get that flour and bacon, and some matches. I've got to
      get across the river. I can shake 'em off, on the other side. Hurry, Val!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went out into the kitchen, and they heard her moving about, collecting
      the things he needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have to take your horse, Kent.&rdquo; Manley turned to him with a certain
      wheedling tone, infinitely disgusting to the other. &ldquo;Mine's all in&mdash;I
      rode him down, getting this far. I've got to get across the river, and
      into the hills the other side&mdash;I can dodge 'em over there. You can
      have my horse&mdash;he's good as yours, anyway.&rdquo; He seemed to fed a slight
      discomfort at Kent's silence. &ldquo;You've always stood by me&mdash;anyway, it
      wasn't so much my fault&mdash;he came at me unawares, and says 'Man
      Fleetwood, you're my prisoner!' Why, the very tone of him was an insult&mdash;and
      I won't stand for being arrested&mdash;I pulled my gun and got him through
      the lungs&mdash;heard 'em yelling he was dead&mdash;Hurry up with that
      grub! I can't wait here till&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to tell you Michael's no good for water,&rdquo; Kent forced himself to
      say. &ldquo;He's liable to turn back on you; he's scared of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won't turn back with <i>me</i>&mdash;not with old Jake Bondy at my
      heels!&rdquo; Manley snatched the bag of provisions from Val when she appeared,
      and started for the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You better leave off some of that hardware, then,&rdquo; Kent advised
      perfunctorily. &ldquo;You're liable to have to swim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care how I get across, just so&mdash;&rdquo; A panic seemed to seize
      him then. Without a word of thanks or farewell he rushed out, threw
      himself into Kent's saddle without taking time to tie on his bundle of
      bacon and flour, or remembering the blanket he had asked for. Holding his
      provisions under his arm, his rifle in one hand, and his reins clutched in
      the other, he struck the spurs home and raced down the coulee toward the
      river. Fred and Polycarp had not troubled to put up the wire gate after
      emptying the river field, so he had a straight run of it to the very river
      bank. The two stood together at the window and watched him go.

      CHAPTER XXIV. RETRIBUTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thought it was I burned out that, brand; did you notice what he said?&rdquo;
       Val, as frequently happens in times of stress, spoke first of a trivial
      matter, before her mind would grasp the greater issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll never make it,&rdquo; said Kent, speaking involuntarily his thought.
      &ldquo;There comes old Jake Bondy, now, down the hill. Still, I dunno&mdash;if
      Michael takes to the water all right&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the sheriff comes here, what shall we tell him? Shall we&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won't. He's turning off, don't you see? He must have got a sight of
      Man from the top of the hill. Michael's tolerably fresh, and Jake's horse
      isn't; that makes a big difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val weakened unexpectedly, as the full meaning of it all swept through her
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's horrible!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Kent, what can we do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a thing, only keep our heads, and don't give way to nerves,&rdquo; he
      hinted. &ldquo;It's something out of our reach; let's not go all to pieces over
      it, pal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She steadied under his calm voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm always acting foolish just at the wrong time&mdash;but to think he
      could&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't think! You'll have enough of that to do, managing your own affairs.
      All this doesn't change a thing for you. It makes you feel bad&mdash;and
      for that I could kill him, almost!&rdquo; So much flashed out, and then he
      brought himself in hand again. &ldquo;You've still got to pack your trunks, and
      take the train home, just the same as if this hadn't happened. I didn't
      like the idea at first, but now I see it's the best thing you can do, for
      the present. After awhile&mdash;we'll see about it. Don't look out, if it
      upsets you, Val. You can't do any good, and you've got to save your
      nerves. Let pull down the shade&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I've got to see!&rdquo; Perversely, she caught up the field glasses from
      the table, drew them from their case, and, letting down the upper window
      sash with a slam, focused the glasses upon the river. &ldquo;He usually crosses
      right at the mouth of the coulee&mdash;&rdquo; She swung the glasses slowly
      about. &ldquo;Oh, there he is&mdash;just on the bank. The river looks rather
      high&mdash;oh, your horse doesn't want to go in, Kent. He whirls on his
      hind feet, and tried to bolt when Manley started in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent had been watching her face jealously. &ldquo;Here, let me take a look, will
      you? I can tell&mdash;&rdquo; She yielded reluctantly, and in a moment he had
      caught the focus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what you see, Kent&mdash;everything,&rdquo; she begged, looking
      anxiously from his face to the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, old Jake is fogging along down the coulee&mdash;but he ain't to the
      river yet, not by a long shot! Ah-h! Man's riding back to take a run in.
      That's the stuff&mdash;got Michael's feet wet that time, the old freak!
      They came near going clean outa sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sheriff&mdash;is he close enough&mdash;&rdquo; Val began fearfully. &ldquo;Oh,
      we're too far away to do a thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent kept his eyes to the glasses. &ldquo;We couldn't do a thing if we were
      right there. Man's in swimming water already. Jake ain't riding in&mdash;from
      the motions he's ordering Man back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please let me look a minute! I won't get excited, Kent, and I'll tell
      you everything I see&mdash;<i>please!</i>&rdquo; Val's teeth were fairly
      chattering with excitement, so that Kent hesitated before he gave up the
      glasses. But it seemed boorish to refuse. She snatched at them as he took
      them from his eyes, and placed them nervously to her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see them both!&rdquo; she cried, after a second or two. &ldquo;The sheriff's
      got his rifle in his hands&mdash;Kent, do you suppose he'd&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a bluff, pal. They all do it. What&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val gave a start. &ldquo;Oh, he shot, Kent! I saw him take aim&mdash;it looked
      as if he pointed it straight at Manley, and the smoke&mdash;&rdquo; She moved
      the glasses slowly, searching the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he'd have to be a dandy, to hit anything on the water, and with the
      sun in his eyes, too,&rdquo; Kent assured her, hardly taking his eyes from her
      face with its varying expression. Almost he could see what was taking
      place at the river, just by watching her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there's Manley, away out! Why, your Michael is swimming beautifully,
      Kent! His head is high out of the water, and the water is churning like&mdash;Oh,
      Manley's holding his rifle up over his head&mdash;he's looking back toward
      shore. I wonder,&rdquo; she added softly, &ldquo;what he's thinking about! Manley!
      you're my husband&mdash;and once I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Draw a bead on that gazabo on shore,&rdquo; Kent interrupted her faint faring
      up of sentiment toward the man she had once loved and loved no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Val drew a long breath and turned the glasses reluctantly from the
      fugitive. &ldquo;I don't see him&mdash;oh, yes! He's down beside a rock, on one
      knee, and he's taking a rest across the rock, and is squinting along&mdash;oh,
      he can't hit him at that distance, can he, Kent? Would he dare&mdash;why,
      it would be murder, wouldn't it? Oh-h&mdash;<i>he shot again</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent reached up a hand and took the glasses from her eyes with a masterful
      gesture. &ldquo;You let me look,&rdquo; he said laconically. &ldquo;I'm steadier than you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Val crept closer to him, and looked up into his face. She could read
      nothing there; his mouth was shut tight so that it was a stern, straight
      line, but that told her nothing. He always looked so when he was intent
      upon something, or thinking deeply. She turned her eyes toward the river,
      flowing smoothly across the mouth of the coulee. Between, the land lay
      sleeping lazily in the hazy sunlight of mid-autumn. The grass was brown,
      the rocky outcroppings of the coulee wall yellow and gray and red&mdash;and
      the river was so blue, and so quiet! Surely that sleepy coulee and that
      placid river could not be witnessing a tragedy. She turned her head,
      irritated by its very calmness. Her eyes dwelt wistfully upon Kent's
      half-concealed face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they doing now, Kent?&rdquo; Her tone was hushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't&mdash;exactly&mdash;&rdquo; He mumbled absently, his mind a mile away.
      She waited a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you see&mdash;Manley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time he did not answer at all; he seemed terribly far off, as if only
      his shell of a body remained with her in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you talk?&rdquo; she wailed. She waited until she could endure no
      more, then reached up and snatched the glasses from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't help it&mdash;I shall go crazy standing here. I've just got to
      see!&rdquo; she panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he clung to the glasses and stared down at her. &ldquo;You better
      not, sweetheart,&rdquo; he urged gently, but when she still held fast he let
      them go. She raised them hurriedly to her eyes, and turned to the river
      with a shrinking impatience to know the worst and have it over with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;E-everything j-joggles so,&rdquo; she whimpered complainingly, trying vainly to
      steady the glasses. He slipped his arms around her, and let her lean
      against him; she did not even seem to realize it. Just then she had caught
      sight of something, and her intense interest steadied her so that she
      stood perfectly still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, your horse&mdash;&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Michael&mdash;he's got his feet
      straight up in the air&mdash;oh, Kent, he's rolling over sad over! I can't
      see&mdash;&rdquo; She held her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glasses sagged as if they had grown all at once too heavy to hold. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
      thought I saw&mdash;&rdquo; She shivered and hid her face upon one upflung arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent caught up the glasses and looked long at the river, unmindful of the
      girl sobbing wildly beside him. Finally he turned to her, hesitated, and
      then gathered her close in his arms. The glasses slid unheeded to the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't cry&mdash;it's better this way, though it's hard enough, God
      knows.&rdquo; His voice was very gentle. &ldquo;Think how awful it would have been,
      Val, if the law had got him. Don't cry like that! Such things are
      happening every day, somewhere&mdash;&rdquo; He realized suddenly that this was
      no way to comfort her, and stopped. He patted her shoulder with a sense of
      blank helplessness. He could make love&mdash;but this was not the time for
      love-making; and since he was denied that outlet for his feelings, he did
      not know what to do, except that he led her to the couch, and settled her
      among the cushions so that she would be physically comfortable, at least.
      He turned restlessly to the window, looked; out, and then went to the
      couch and bent over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going out to the gate&mdash;I want to see Jake Bondy. He's coming up
      the coulee,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I won't be far. Poor little girl&mdash;poor little
      pal, I wish I could help you.&rdquo; He touched his lips to her hair, so lightly
      she could not feel it, and left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the gate he met, not the sheriff, who was riding slowly, and had just
      passed through the field gate, but Arline and Hank, rattling up in the
      Hawley buck-board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank the good Lord!&rdquo; he exclaimed when he helped her from the rig. &ldquo;I
      never was so glad to see anybody in my life. Go on in&mdash;she's in there
      crying her heart out. Man's dead&mdash;the sheriff shot him in the river&mdash;oh,
      there's been hell to pay out here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My heavens above!&rdquo; Arline stared up at him while she grasped the
      significance of his words. &ldquo;I knowed he'd hit for here&mdash;I followed
      right out as quick as Hank could hitch up the team. Did you hear about
      Fred&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes, I know all about it!&rdquo; Kent was guilty of pulling her
      through the gate, and then pushing her toward the house. &ldquo;You go and do
      something for that poor girl. Pack her up and take her to town as quick as
      God'll let you. There's been misery enough for her out here to kill a
      dozen women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He watched until she had reached the porch, and then swung back to Hank,
      sitting calmly in the buckboard, with the lines gripped between his knees
      while he filled his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can take care of the man's side of this business, fast enough,&rdquo; Kent
      confessed whimsically, &ldquo;but there's some things it takes a woman to
      handle.&rdquo; He glanced again over his shoulder, gave a huge sigh of relief
      when he glimpsed Arline's thin face as she passed the window and knelt
      beside the couch, and turned with a lighter heart to meet the sheriff.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
