description: 'Lonesome Land (1912) delicately balances an idealistic, romantic view
  of the American West with its hard, gritty reality. Although focused on the West''s
  often lonesome and open lifestyle, scenes of true Western-genre suspense appear
  in this critical yet beautiful imaging of the land and its pioneers.<P style=MARGIN:
  0in 0in 0pt> <P style=MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt>Valeria Peyson has spent her life on the
  East Coast and, therefore, holds a beautifully serene vision of the West in her
  mind. But in relocating to Hope, Montana, she discovers the hardships of the West''s
  remote, male-centered way of lifestarting with her marriage to a drunken failure,
  Manley Fleetwood. The west, however, is not without the romantic aspect that Valeria
  hoped to find. Coming to terms with both kinds of experience, she grows into a stronger
  person.'
